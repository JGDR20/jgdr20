A London-based support monkey with several years experience in MS SQL, application and OS support, plus several more years of customer service.

### About Me:

Photography is a hobby of mine; I’m certainly an amateur but I enjoy exploring new places (a camera is a great excuse) and experimenting with post-production techniques – currently I’m exploring HDR techniques and macro photography.

Twice a week I also play D&D with friends, so far as a player but I’ll also be running a campaign in the coming months. I’ve found that the critical thinking and team skills that I’ve learned during my career have proven surprisingly useful within the game – there is often limited information and time in order to make decisions that will affect both a single character and the party as a whole.

### Relevant Experience:

#### DBs and SQL:

In my current and previous roles I have become familiar with the MS SQL suite as I have used SSMS, SQL Profiler and Analysis Services often. Additionally I have created and maintained; Views, Stored Procedures, Tables, Constraints as well as providing training to colleagues.

As part of my regular tasks I can:

* Query SQL databases using multi-table joins, temporary tables, CTEs etc. with the results targeted for an appropriate audience
* Update/Delete data
* Manage backups and restores into different environments

As part of my current role I also use Firebird (2.5) with IBConsole for a number of support applications used by our current products, as well as our legacy product.

#### Web/Programming Technologies:

I have been exposed to classic asp, asp.net, VB.NET, C#, HTML, CSS & Javascript for troubleshooting purposes, as well as some home research for personal projects.

#### Customer Service:

Prior to my roles on support teams I worked in Retail for some years, the majority of which was spent in customer-facing roles. During this time I’ve gained a great deal of patience and a positive attitude when interacting with both internal and external clients (in my technical roles I have provided internal support alongside the other members of my team); I’ve been mentioned by name in a number of client feedback communications and have been requested as a point of contact by several clients.

#### Security:

As part of their support contracts I have been security cleared by 2 previous clients; one was specific to the client and the other was for a government body. Whilst both applications were specific to my previous employment at Computers in Personnel I am willing to undergo scrutiny for sensitive clients.
