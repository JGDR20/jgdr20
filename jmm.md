My Grandad, John G. Richardson, passed away in March '20. He goes to join his wife Francis 'Nana' Olwen and is survived by two sons and several grandchildren.

For the majority of his life John was a keen draughtsman, engineer and occasional artist, some of which can be found on his website.

He also has a section in Martin Davis' [Model Boat Mayhem site][JohnModelBoatMayhem].

As with all people, he was much more than can be encompassed by the writing of 
any one individual. To me he was Grandad, Dad to my own Dad, Husband, Neighbour, 
Colleague, Friend. So, I'll let him speak for himself:

## About John G. Richardson
*Written by John G. Richardson*

Leaving school at 15 with some School Certificates ( The equivalent of todays O 
level exams ) in Art , Architecture, English and Maths. John tried a number of 
jobs then at 17, on the insistance of the family, he took the UK Civil Service 
Examination and, un-beknown to them, purposely failed, as he definitely did not 
want to become a Civil Servant ! 

Architectural studies commenced when employed as a draftsman with a well-known 
firm of architects. The partners in the firm had both been senior officers in 
the Royal Engineers, as had John's Grandfather and Uncle, the former having been 
through The Boer War so there was plenty of encouragement to join up. 

John enlisted in the Engineers when a path opened for a Duration of Emergency 
Commision. This entailed War Office Selection Board then Infantry Training 
followed by Royal Engineers Corps Training in all apects of field engineering 
such as bridging, demolition and explosives, use of equipment, military law etc. 

On leaving the army and joining a construction firm experience was gained whilst 
assisting a Contract Manager based at head office then an Agent on detachment on 
a construction site. The company had a substantial joinery works and later work 
as a draftsman in that department provided experience in general joinery, museum 
and hospital fitting as well as drafting work on a 12' x 9' working section for 
a major Wind Tunnel, on the formwork for constructions such as the Sellafield 
Chimneys and on spillway models for Hydro-electric Dams 

Formwork and Mouldwork for concrete, a speciality of the firm, became John's 
major interest and shaped the future for him. Formwork for insitu concrete and 
Mouldwork for precast concrete elements would feature in most aspects of Johns 
career in 20 years as a Designer, Supervisor and Works Manager on Insitu 
concrete construction and in Precast Concrete works. Products of these works 
included Cladding Panels and substantial prestressed beams for Motorway bridges 
and River crossings. 

At 43 John became a lecturer/trainer with the Cement Industry Trainining and 
Research Establishment working at all levels including with Engineers, 
Architects, Foremen, Supervisors and Tradesmen, this led to work abroad in 
Scandinavia, Europe, India, North Africa and North and South America. 

At 59 John set up as Private Consultant and worked with more than 40 firms, 
dealing with concrete manufacture and production including arbitration, also 
working as a visiting lecturer in Colleges and Universities, as well as carrying 
out technical assessments for BSI in the precast industry, carrying on working 
to the age of 75. 

John holds a Silver Medal of the City and Guilds of London Institute for whom he 
was an Examiner for 20 years. is a past Fellow of the Institute of Concrete 
Technology and has a Diploma in Works Management 

Publications include six books on practical aspects of Formwork and Mould Design 
and on construction topics including Supervision of Concrete Construction and 
Product Quality as well as several sketch books on practicalities. Unusually his 
first book was published when John was working as a supervisor in the precast 
concrete industry ! 

Throughout all these years John has been making models of various kinds and 
assembling a workshop where he can tackle any type of timber or metal work. 
Other hobbies include Cartoons and artwork, the cartoons provided some useful 
income throughout 25 years of contributions to magazines and in CDs and DVDs 
used in Continuing Professional Education.
