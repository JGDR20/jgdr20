A while ago I went to Basel with my family to see my [Uncle George](GeorgeRicci) in Basel. It was a fantastic trip and a really nice city to walk through, even if you do have to dodge bikes. Everyone I met seemed to be at least bilingual, if not tri-, which did make me feel like a proper Brit Abroad. A fair few vegan options as well which definitely helped.

More photos to come - got distracted while processing them and haven't got back to them in... wow, 5 months!
