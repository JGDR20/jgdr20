The Redbrands are finished; either dead or sent packing. <!-- more -->
We snuck into their ‘stronghold’ and surprised that Glasstaff fellow – he folded like a milksop, didn’t really offer any real resistance.
Well, he didn’t have time! A rattle of dwarfish steel and a few well chosen words broke his spirit.

Glasstaff apparently hasn’t been doing all this hisself, there’s a mysterious ‘Black Spider’ that’s been weaving a web around the area (Hah! A web!).
Guess he’s next on the list – I’ll wager this motley crew has been gaining a reputation in these parts.
Certainly Star is walking tall and I’ve been enjoying far too much of the local ale being slung our way.

Not that you’ll catch me complaining.
