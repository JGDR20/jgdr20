Hello Jayna,

We have just arrived at Bazzoxan-proper although our group is worse-for-wear.  
Gurgle was sadly a casualty of particularly vicious bandits that plague The 
Barbed Fields - those directly responsible have been dealt with however I fear 
travellers will continue to be plagued by other desperados. <!-- more -->

Last night was spent deep in cups, celebrating the end of a taxing journey and 
commiserating with Malu on the loss of his friend; I fear I am not as young as 
I once was and the hangover is going to be impressive.

I'm looking forward to refamiliarising myself with Bazzoxan and showing young 
Zelithia around. I hope the nature of this place may yield some answers to 
her own quest (the details of which shall remain a private affair).

Speaking of private affairs, what news of your assistant's intrigue? Also, how 
is that young Orc from the Inn? Has he made successful travel arrangements? 
Should this letter reach you before he leaves please relay my standing
invitation for company to Rosohna - the route seems more dangerous than I last 
remember.

I trust you remain in good health and are making good use of the mules and cart. 
If you see her, please pass my regards to your cousin as well.

Yours,

Lt. V. Waccoh

P.S. The group sends their regards.
