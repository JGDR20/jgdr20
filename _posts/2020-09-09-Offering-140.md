My Queen,

My unexpected relocations appear to be more long-term than I had orinally thought but does seem to grant more opportunities than usual to perform your work. The group has found itself in the coerced employ of the Efficient Beurocratic Adventuring Company, sealed by an arcane contract that indicates the owners retain some *thing* of ours that shall be returned on completion of the terms of the contract. The specific *thing* held is unclear but I find the chance that it could be my soul problematic to your cause.<!-- more -->

Putting the specifics of the contract aside, other employees of the Efficient Beurocratic Adventuring Company show vast potential of experience; one I have spoken to has seen the demise of two groups of colleagues whilst employed and I sense that this still pains her for now. Unfortunately from brief observation it appears that these employees are more taciturn than you would expect from the adventuring sort. Still, I am ever attentative to my purpose.

Your ever-faithful Collector,  
Lia
