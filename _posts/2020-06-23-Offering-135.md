My Queen,

I was unable to complete the last rites on the minstrel in Farview, however I was able to transcribe her moment of hopelessness and offer a locket given to her by her Aunt. By Your Grace may her Journey be untroubled.

I find myself unexpectedly taken to Bannock, a small yet propserous fishing village, and in the company of strangers.<!-- more --> I shall continue to apply myself to your cause - some of my new companions seem to have lead textured lives that may be worth cataloging for you. Given our unusual circumstance, they may be in need of Your Grace soon as well.

Your ever-faithful Collector,  
Lia
