The story begins in Greenest, as you get a view of the village, it is in utter chaos, homes burning, people fleeing, almost like the apocalypse has begun. Above the village, an Adult Blue Dragon is flying in circles, while cultists from the Cult of the Dragon raid the village with kobolds under their commands, stealing anything that looks remotely valuable.

Your Party tries their best to reach the keep in Greenest, rescuing a few innocent villagers in the process. When your group arrives in the castle, the dragon uses its breath to fry some guards on the walls; it flies off after being attacked a bit, possibly out of boredom or disinterest.  

The next day, your Party is asked by the governor of Greenest to locate the cultists' camp, where a monk by the name of Leosin is held hostage; he is holding vital information about the cult and their plans. One way or another, your Party manages to free and save Leosin.  

You return to the castle of Greenest, and the Governor and Leosin are extremely thankful. After a quick briefing, your Party was told to return to the camp and check what can be found in the caves located there. There are several large eggs (possibly dragon eggs) to be found, as well as one of the leaders of the cult, who tried their best to flee but fails.  

Your Party then learns about the plans left behind by the cult, which state that the treasure is to be transported by carts hidden among a normal caravan on a trading route to Waterdeep.  

While traveling with the caravan (which took about 2 months), you learn that working with the cultists is a powerful group called the Red Wizard of Thay.  

Once in Waterdeep, some investigation by your Party revealed that the goods are being sent north to a roadhouse used to maintain the road between Waterdeep and Neverwinter. Once there, more investigation leads to finding a hidden tunnel where lizardfolk are transporting the treasure a few days of travel away to the castle in the Mere of Dead Men. When you fight the lizardfolk, one surrenders ( and joined your party - Snapjaw) and begs them to help him overthrow the cult in the castle, so that the lizardfolk may no longer be abused by the bullywugs (frogmen).  

Your group enters the castle and learns over some time that there is a portal in the basement, you eventually reach the teleportation circle in the basement. Once you teleport your way, to the nearby village of Parnast, to get onto the flying castle that will soon leave.  

Your Party, faced off against the owner of the castle, The castle also houses a guardian to protect the hoards, which attacks the player characters as you dared to enter its lair. And took control of the castle.
