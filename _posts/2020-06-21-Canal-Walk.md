As the lockdown restrictions start being lifted in England (which could have happened earlier if the government hadn't decided that ~~sacrificial~~ herd immunity was the best course of action), I'm going to try and get off my arse more and walk in the mornings before work.

The first walk was on Saturday and it was really nice, although I had to get up *far* earlier than usual to avoid people as much as possible. I've included some photos from the walk below.
