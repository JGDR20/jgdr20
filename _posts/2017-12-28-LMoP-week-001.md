Two days. Two days in and we run into a goblin ambush. Who’s been keeping this trail clear of these vermin? <!-- more -->
We made short work of all but one but there’s been signs of more as we’ve travelled.
Has Marthammor forgotten this place or have we been sent to clear the way for others?

The one that we captured was very informative – after a little persuasion.
The information was not comforting; Gundren and Sildar have been captured and taken to the goblins’ hideout.
I honestly can’t believe Gundren allowed himself to get captured, he must be getting soft.
It was decided we’ll camp downwind of the cave entrance (much to the offence of my nostrils) and attack in the morning.
Not sure what we’re up against, the goblin can’t bloody count. Figures.

There is another odd smell in the air, almost masked by the stink of goblin. I can’t place it but it makes me uneasy.
