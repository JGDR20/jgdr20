My Queen,

The secrets of Bergvorn are being revealed; the cleric's flock encompasses more than just the wretched villagers. In a moment of hubris the cleric has attempted to evict our group from the village with the aid of a sea-witch and numerous abominations rising from the sea - the fight does not seem to bode well for them but I am unsure whether they are worthy of your attentions. A complication has arisen in the form of Mip who has let loose a pair of Dretches on the unprepared villagers, one of whom has succumbed to the experience. I shall seek payment from the villager for my service in due course, once the Dretch have been suitably returned to their proper place. I imagine Mip to be the repository and cause of many of your interests and I forsee many opportunities to collect.

If my ears do not deceive it sounds like my duties will be required elsewhere in the fight shortly. When this is done I believe I will take some personal satisfaction tending to the cleric.

Your ever-faithful Collector,  
Lia
