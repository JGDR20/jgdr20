Hail, friends! My name is Gustril Largeblade, Gus for you folks. <!-- more -->
I’m an ex-mercenary, formerly garrisoned at Neverwinter, and this is a chronicle of my life since leaving the company.

Earlier this week I got a message that Cousin Gundren was in town, looking for some folks to escort one of his merchant wagons out of town.
The timing was so shiny! Here I am, walking round with my arse in my hands and Marthammor hands me an honest, paying job that gets me out of town.
Gundren said he was having troubles getting shipments through to a trade partner of his down in Phandalin and had heard I was looking for a job – as I said, shiny.

Anyways, we head over to a local alehouse so he can introduce me to everyone and never did I see such a sorry bunch of misfits.
I’ve no idea where he dredged them up from but they all seemed eager to get started. Let me see if I can get their names right:

* There’s the halfling called Bree who was deep into a flagon near half their size. Kept one eye on the door and another on the ale.
* The human kid, Star, who I’d seen around the docks before. Full of piss and vinegar when I last saw him on my rounds, squaring off to some bastard captain.
* An elf by the name Lycinda. Haughty one, for an elf, but they mentioned clearing up some goblin mess so no complaints from me.
* “Sir” Norris.  You could damn near hear the silver spoon up his arse (terrible place to keep silver). No idea what a Sir is doing on this trip but what can you do?
* And lastly Sildar, I recognised him from the barracks. Handy when the alehouses kick out, he’s got a fair reach on him.

I think that about covers it, Gundren said he’d be heading off tomorrow with Sildar to sort out some business before we arrive.
We’re just waiting on the Dockmaster to clear the goods some time the day after then we’ll be heading off as well.

I think some time away from the city to relax and take in the sights shall do me some good.
