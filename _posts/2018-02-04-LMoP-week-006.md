Bree wasn’t quite herself today, just a little… off. <!-- more -->
But then she caught herself a little bloodsucking beastie and she perked right up.
She’s named the mangy thing ‘Fluffy’ and feeds it scraps when she thinks we’re not looking.
Halflings, I’ll never have the ken of them but her spirits are high so who am I to complain?
As long as she keeps it away from me.

We’re getting closer to Cragmore Castle and I’ll finally see my Cousin again.
I’m actually looking forward to his war stories, I’ll grant he has a few new ones by now!
To be fair I’ve got a couple myself; we’ve seen off some more goblins (fething savages, they’ll take the shine right off your axe with their stink), plus a shifty-looking mage and his zombies.
Eurgh, makes me want to have a wash just thinking about them and I only had one last week!

Anyways, best be off, his lordship is having trouble with his bedroll again. What do they teach these younglings at those fancy colleges?
