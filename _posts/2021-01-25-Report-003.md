### Summary:
ARC had a mutual aid contract with the Guild of Alchemists prior to ARC's collapse, with Jorgen Poss as the Point of Contact. Subsequent to the collapse Jorgen has sent multiple requests for ARC jobs that have been unfulfilled - as a sign of good faith we will complete the priority requests.

Hall Red 3 was infested with sentient Oozes that appeared to seek to extend the power/reach/knowledge of Juiblex, described as 'The Hungering Ooze, Father of All Oozes'. During initial investigation of the building we encountered Oozes disguised as the Receptionist Sybil, as well as had a discussion with Head Researcher Duncan Oblerbroen - both were able to participate in conversation but occasionally gave uncanny answers.  
On making entry into the main research lab we encountered a sentient Blood Ooze in the service of Jubilex and of considerable size that attempted to offer us power in exchange for freedom. It is possible that a similar offer was made to the original Alchemists but this is personal speculation. Regardless, it appears that all persons present in the Hall have been killed/absorbed by the oozes.  
The main Blood Ooze was contained in what appears to be a purpose-built cold room; this alongside our successful freezing and dismantling of the ooze indicates the creature is vulnerable to freezing temperatures. Attacks with heat, whilst successful, were not as effective.  
Vaselnor's Journal appears to have been an anchor point that the main Blood Ooze was unwilling or unable to physically part with. The journal has been removed from the remains of the ooze and taken back to ARC HQ for safekeeping. See attached documentation for containment measures.  
The primary infestation has been cleared however at least some ooze entity(ies) are known to have been existing outside of the Hall as we were attacked on a cablecar from Fishpoint to Freehold by oozes taking the appearance of Volch (one of the Alchemist Lab Assitants) as well as a young family of 3 (see Guild of Wires report for damage and rescue). These have been neutralised but it is unknown whether others remain and if more will be created. Regrettably a half-elf civilian was killed by the oozes in the fight on the cablecar.

ARC has a tentative deal with Zariel on behalf of at least some of the Underlake community. The Underlake community seems to be very suspicious and keen to remain as unknown as possible, motivations at this point are unknown however initial contact was *relatively* benign given the circumstances. An ongoing relationship may be beneficial, although as the politics and intentions of the Underlake community are unknown to ARC at this time caution is advised.

#### Reclaim condemned Alchemists Guild property "Hall Red 3"
**Hall Red 3 has been successully reclaimed for the Guild of Alchemists from Blood Ooze infestation**
The property itself is of less importance, the real objective is to recover Vaselnor's journal.
Discretion required.
Information so far:

* Hall Red 3
  * Restricted project research
  * Edge of Fishpoint, over water on stilts
  * 2 storey building
  * 175' x 95'
  * 5 permanent staff, 3 living on-site, 2 commuting
    * Head Researcher - Duncan Oblerbroen
	* 3x Assistants
	* Clerc/Receptionist - Sybil
  * Researching Vaselnor's journal
  * 8 years 11 months ago this hall stopped shipping goods and supplying research
  * 2x Guild Members were sent to check-in with researchers, neither returned
  * Watch went to investigate
    * 2x Guards and 1x Investigator went in, didn't returned
	* Some number remained outside, returned unscathed but no knowledge of what happened to other members
  * Observers noticed activity within (lights turning on/off etc.) but no figures or clear view of details
  * Theorised that either some dangerous creature has taken residence or some experiment went wrong
  * **Note: all members appear to have been consumed by Ooze(s) that appear to be able to mimic appearance and knowledge of victims.  
    Further sightings of victims should be approached with extreme caution**


* Vaselnor
  * Previous Head Researcher for Hall Red 3
  * Expelled for unsanctioned dangerous research
    * Demons?
	* *Personal note: if there is Demonic involvement, look for signs of Rian*
  * Deceased or disappeared
  * Research journal discovered sometime after disappearance
  * Hall Red 3 continuing research from journal prior to 'event'
  * Journal
    * Red book
	* Tattered round one edge
	* Cover is permanently slimey
	* Recommend caution whilst handling
	* Poss has instructed that the journal is not to be opened

#### Procure harder-to-find alchemical supplies


**N.B.** We have travelled to Fishpoint to test Ten-zing's theory that 'Buddy' the World Tree bud may grow better outside of the shadow of its progenitor. This theory has not yet *born fruit* but Ten-zing continues his efforts. Perhaps gaining standing with The Gardeners may allow ARC access to plants that the Guild of Alchemists seek.

Myself and Mr. Wizardman have taken an introductory course in Alchemy whilst in Fishpoint. The course was rudimentary but I can see a common methodolgy with the basics of Artificery - not quite as intricate as Artificing, of course, but interesting nonetheless. I may seek to continue instruction in this field to see whether I can incorporate some new thought-processes into my work. Mr. Wizardman appears less taken with the practice.

Ten-zing and Al appear to have had an encounter with some sentient creature in the Pine Forest Island on Oer-sky Lake. They have returned unscathed but a little rattled.
Additional Information: Zariel advised that the creature is the Prince of Underlake, son of the King (missing?). Caution advised.

In the process of fighting the oozes from the cablecar a number of both mine and Ten-zing's personal possesions were destroyed by acid. As we were operating under ARC business, can we claim compensation? Attached is a list of my personal losses.
