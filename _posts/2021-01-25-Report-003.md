### Summary:
ARC had a mutual aid contract with the Guild of Alchemists prior to ARC's collapse, with Jorgen Poss as the Point of Contact. Subsequent to the collapse Jorgen has sent multiple requests for ARC jobs that have been unfulfilled - as a sign of good faith we will complete the priority requests.

#### Reclaim condemned Alchemists Guild property "Hall Red 3"
The property itself is of less importance, the real objective is to recover Vaselnor's journal.
Discretion required.

More information to follow.

**N.B.** We have travelled to Fishpoint to test Ten-zing's theory that 'Buddy' the World Tree bud may grow better outside of the shadow of its progenitor. This theory has not yet *born fruit* but Ten-zing continues his efforts. Perhaps gaining standing with The Gardeners may allow ARC access to plants that the Guild of Alchemists seek.

Myself and Mr. Wizardman have taken an introductory course in Alchemy whilst in Fishpoint. The course was rudimentary but I can see a common methodolgy with the basics of Artificery - not quite as intricate as Artificing, of course, but interesting nonetheless. I may seek to continue instruction in this field to see whether I can incorporate some new thought-processes into my work. Mr. Wizardman appears less taken with the practice.

Ten-zing and Al appear to have had an encounter with some sentient creature in the Pine Forest Island on Oer-sky Lake. They have returned unscathed but a little rattled.
