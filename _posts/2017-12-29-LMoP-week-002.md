We’ve found Sildar, but there’s still no sign of Gundren. <!-- more -->
Our exploits in the cave revealed something interesting, apparently the goblins (and orcs!) have been employed by some bloody wizard (no disrespect to Lycinda) called Glasstaff.
We’ve recovered a trove of supplies that look like they’ve been looted from hapless travellers and traders passing through.
I’ll grant we won’t find the owners anywhere in this life, poor blighters, but we’re going to haul it with us to Phandalin just in case.
There was some reluctance on this but the stuff isn’t rightfully ours, certainly not until we’ve at least checked with the town.

I made a bit of a mess in the cave, I’m not normally one to go charging in but the thought of getting my cousin back (and a sincere longing to get the hell out of that stuffy cave – I know I keep going on about it but the stench!) got to my head.
Still, everyone made it out and I healed the worst of the injuries so hopefully there’s no hard feelings.
I’ll keep my head down in the future.
