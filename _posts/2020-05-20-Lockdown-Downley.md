There was some unwelcome but not unexpected family news just before the lockdown started in the UK so I ended up staying with my parents for a few months.  
It was nice to be back and there was certainly a lot more space to go walking than in London but I did miss a few things (mainly the computer). We managed to get quite a lot of board games done, including T.I.M.E. Stories which I might write a review about later.
