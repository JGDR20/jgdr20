### Summary:
At Sir Nackle's request we assisted with the Guild of Blades', Seekers' and Royal Guard investigations into unexplained delays and thefts from the Lightning Rail between Freehold and Ranadonia.  
Available information indicated that the events were not on every journey and that the attackers were capable of killing, although this did not happen with every theft. The nature of the attack (detailed below) offers a reason for inconsistent violence.  
The targets of the thefts appear to be artifacts from The War plus high-end personal valuables which suggests that the attackers have some inside knowledge of when the items are being moved.

In order to both entice an attack and not arouse suspicion we attempted to pass ourselves off as security for a faked artifact of our own. Whilst the faked artifact proved unnecessary we were able to gain access to the cargo hold where a real artifact was being guarded by a retinue from the Guild of Blades. This retinue had been on a number of identical escort missions but had been unsuccessful in deterring or identifying the attackers due to reported memory loss. This explanation lines up with our encounter.

As the train neared Dustchoke a red gas was pumped into the carriages and the train brought to a halt. The airship 'The Vengeance' was used to drop a Pneumatic Knight at the rear of the train to secure the artifact whilst 'The Boys' were dropped at the front to secure the locomotive.  
At this time Agent Wizardman, situated in the first-class carriages, was rendered unconscious and had his rapier stolen by an apparent noblewoman with a bee necklace. This thief stole other valuable items from first-class before leaving via magic to The Five Span Spire. As this person appeared to have foreknowledge of the attack but played no active role (other than theft) I believe she is an opportunistic thief with access to criminal information.

The attack continued on two fronts; with ARC Agent Ten-Zing and Swiftwind of the Guild of Seekers incapacitating the goblin group 'The Boys' towards the front and Agent Wizardman assisting in regaining control of the locomotive, and the rest of ARC and Vert's Guild of Blades retinue attempting to protect the artifact. The porter 'Teddy' was revealed to be working with the attackers and was eventually killed.  
The Pneumatic Knight was incapacitated but a further Knight and an agent of URN became involved and were successful in throwing the artifact's container out of a door before retreating. At this point neither ARC nor the Guilds' Agents were capable of persuing due to wounds and exhaustion.

The artifact was later retrieved by Agent Wizardman - it does not look like 'The Vengeance' attempted to recover it. The container was found exploded and a circle of sand approximatley 30 feet across was vitrified, centred on the impact point of the artifact. Agent Wizardman reports that the artifact glowed intensely when he was stood at the edge of the circle but the glowe diminished upon approach.

Interrogation of Mic Glorb, leader of The Boys, revealed the below:
* The Boys were hired by Brando Collosun to stop the train
  * Human
  * 30
  * Fancy looking
  * Wears black and silver
  * Ridiculous hairstyle
  * Condescending
  * Uses the term 'boy'
  * Private airship owner
  * North of Dustchoke
  * Deferential to URN Agent
* Hiring was done in a tavern in Dustchoke - tavern acts as hiring fare for criminals
* Payment was in 'good redsang' and licence to sell under the 'Redsang Pirates' name

The Boys are now incarcerated with the Guild of the Watch while Mic Glorb is to be handed over to the Royal Guard.

The artifact is currently held by ARC and will not be examined at this time.
