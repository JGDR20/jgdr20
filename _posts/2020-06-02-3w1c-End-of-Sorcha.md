After a considerable journey to rescue Traben and his village from Illithids the party went into the Underdark looking for diamonds to attempt to restore victims of the Illithids' destruction. There they came face-to-face with a Tanarukk horde, created and driven by some unknown entity. The Tanarukks proved to be too much for the party who beat a fighting retreat back to the surface - in the process Sorcha was captured and sacrificed in a blood ritual with her soul bound to the Nine Hells. Subsequent attempts to summon her soul back failed and her final fate is unknown.

A while later the party picked up Krodhal, a half-orc stranded out of time. While he played-up to the Orcish stereotypes he was unable to read or write so there are no written records from his perspective of his adventures with the party. Bardic tales are still told of the struggle against a creature older than the Gods who swallowed the world out of spite and jealousy, and a half-orc who broke the teeth of a monstrous plane-spanning leviathon to give his friends a single moment to save all of the realms. However, these are just Bardic fantasy because the world obviously didn't end.
