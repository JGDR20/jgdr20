I'm back and we've had a bit of action these last few days. It's weird, even though things have gotten very strange and frankly disturbing it feels good to get out and *do* something. I was settled in at Ravenloft (and I am still worried about the folks there) but now I feel... alive. And properly creeped out. I'll fill you in.

In my last entry I told you Barbs was calling out for everyone, turns out she sensed Traben go unconscious (some of these gifts from the Ravens feel pretty invasive, to be honest, although I'll let it slide). Ellidar had a little magical look-see to check whether he was just blind-drunk or something else was happening. He told us he saw a hooded figure dropping Traben into a bath of green stuff whilst waving a staff made of vertebrae around. I mean, it *could* be a stag-do or some initiation rites but I think you're supposed to be conscious for those.<!-- more -->

We all high-tailed it down to Easting and the place is deserted; no people, no pets, no birds nor bugs for a few miles. Arrie took Ellidar up for a flyover, buggering off into the clouds whilst the rest of us schlepped our way around the town. Everywhere we went we saw signs that the place had been lived-in; food on the tables, baths full of scummy water, that kind of thing. No bodies or signs of a struggle, though. It gave me the willies at first, then the chills, then the full-on heebie-jeebies - everyone got tense and started checking over their shoulders and around corners. I was convinced something was looking at me and it was clear that the others felt the same way, except for Monty who was a bit puzzled.

Arrie and Elli came down out of the clouds like a bat out of hell - it would have been awe-inspiring had they not both been craning their necks around as if they were being chased which made for a slightly clumsy landing. I guess they had the same feelings we did. Luckily for us they'd found Traben in an estate some way North of the village so we all set off in that direction. I'm a little ashamed to say but I wanted to get the hell out of there so I went by horse. Look, I'm fine being on my own out in the world but that place was just _wrong_. Elli and Rasda both came with me, bless them.

Now the next bit comes from Pravus so you may want to take it with a pinch of salt. The rest of the party followed on foot, with Pravus striding ahead to lead the way, keeping a vigilant eye out for signs of trouble and strife. To be fair to him, it must have worked because he spotted a bloody great big half-orc that I'd completely missed. I saw the bugger later - huge and dressed in fancy clothes. Anyways, Pravus said he approached the half-orc with due care and, on assessing the situation, decided to accompany the creature back to the manor to aid in his search for his family. Monty added that conversations with 'Carlos' were a little strained at this point.

Meanwhile me and my two gallant protectors had reached the estate and had carefully made our way through the gardens. We were silent as shadows, blending into the moon-lit hedges like we were never really there. So you can imagine our surprise when the lady of the estate opened the front door and asked us whether we'd like to come in. Busted. Somewhat chagrined, we made our way up to the house (and very nice it was too). When we got closer the lady Sybil ushered us in, saying it wasn't safe to talk outside. Given that my heebies were still well and truly jeebed at this point I asked if I could cast a little magic to see if I could work out what was making me feel this way. You'd have thought I'd asked if I could take a shit on her carpet with the look she gave me but I did it anyway when her back was turned - I'm all in favour of manners but I'm more in favour of not being smacked upside the head by a pervy arsehole with a stalking fetish. And I'm glad I did, I got a distinct sense of weird coming from her even as I walked in.

Sybil took us into her dining room and we were introduced to her family - 2 humans, a half-elf, a dragon-born and Carlos the half-orc who was supposedly on his way back. Interesting family but I tried not to judge. They were all very polite and, when the others arrived (minus Pravus), offered us a job and dinner, which was served by animated cutlery. This was not the weirdest bit, believe me. While we were eating we tried making conversation. Have you seen those little animated fortune tellers at the circus? Those ones with the gnome inside hurriedly pushing bits of paper with vague portends out of a slot? Talking to these folks was kind of like that, what they said was absolutely fine on its own but didn't always work in context.

"What an interesting selection of food, who prepared it?"

"Yes, we do enjoy a good meal"

Weird.

Tepus, the patriarch and wizard (honestly, that's how he introduced himself) told Carlos to fetch Pravus. Pravus was apparently doing his best impression of a bush, in the middle of the night, surrounded by actual bushes, and Carlos just walked right up to him and invited him in.

Once everyone was inside, in the words of Monty, 'things took a rather unusual turn'. I say shit went pants-on-head crazy but I'm going to have to leave you hanging on that.
