My old tutors were right, the outside world is very different to the Conclave and I'm not sure I like it. Things are a lot more violent than I was expecting. On the plus side I think I can do some real good in this world as there are certainly enough people that need it.

I've been travelling with Cadvan for a while and I'm certain it's a punishment - for who I'm not so sure yet. From what little she's said about her past I think she normally works alone, although she has mentioned other groups she's worked with previously. In fact, she's currently employed an escort of adventurers to take her to Greenest although for the love of Bahamut I can't work out why as she's quite capable of looking after herself.

We've just arrived at Greenest to meet with Leosin the Bard but the town is under attack by a dragon, kobolds and humans. Fires burn everywhere, townsfolk are being killed and homes are being ransacked. We've managed to save a single family from a kobold band who've guided us to the keep - I'm very glad we could save them but it sounds like there are more out there that need help and I yearn to do more, although I fear it is beyond my meagre experience to do so.

Our escort seems similarly out of their depth, although they have done their duty in keeping Cadvan safe on our journey here (even if their methods have been more brutal than I'd like). I don't know what their intentions are now that we have arrived but I pray they will help the folk of Greenest.
