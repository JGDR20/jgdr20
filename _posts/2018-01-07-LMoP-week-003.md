Well we finally made it to Phandalin. <!-- more -->
Strange town, most of the folks are spooked by a bunch calling themselves the Redbrands – bunch of feckless wasters causing trouble for the most part but there seem to be a core of real goblin-rutters holed up somewhere.
Pah, they’ve even stolen away with a wee bairn!
And yet there’s still some schemin’ buggers looking for an angle.
Not sure I trust them meself but the others are game.

Still, we delivered the supplies, got paid and Sildar made good on his promise.
I was steaming at that rusted shite for not sticking with my cousin but the beating that boy got at the hands of that orc turned my hand – the kid looked fair dead on his feet when we got there.
Still, he seems in better spirits now and I’ve had word my cousin is up by Gragmore Castle.
Some of the locals say there may be gold up in those hills which makes me happy as a gnome in muck!
