# *Tales of the Seven Oaks*
## Introduction
Join us as we embark on a fledgling adventure as we set out to make our names (and fortunes) in the world of Faerûn!  
Laugh, joke, cheer and of course weep, for you do not know the dark forces that stand in your path as something monstrous manoeuvres it's pawns for purposes as yet unseen. Can you stand fast and put a stop to it or will you cower with the rest of them in their homes?

Never has the need for heroes been as desperate - are you ready?

## Setting

![Greenest]*Greenest from westpalmsean.com*

<div class="print-block" markdown="1">
The town of Greenest was founded by the halfling Dharva Scatterheart, a rogue who fancied herself the queen of the Greenfields. Scatterheart passed away without ever achieving that level of eminence, but her town grew into a thriving community. Its success isn't surprising, since Greenest is the only town of any size astride the Uldoon Trail, the most direct road between the eastern cities of the Dragon Coast, Cormyr, and Sembia with the Coast Way running south to the great cities of Amn, Tethyr, and far Calimshan. The trade caravans that pass through Greenest bring gold to the town's merchants and craftsfolk, and Governor Nighthill runs the town at the behest of the inhabitants.

## Characters
We're going to use Roll20's built-in "Charactermancer" to build the characters which will help with the process, but beforehand it would be good to have an idea of what kind of character you want to play.

We'd also like everyone to bring a backstory – it doesn’t have to be long but think about the below basics:

* Name
* Age
* Race
	* Human
	* Half-Orc
	* Half-Elf
	* Halfling
	* Something else
* Class
	* Do you want to be hands-on and take the battle to the enemy in hand-to-hand combat or maybe play mind-games from behind the scenes? Perhaps you wish to become a Sorceror to rival the Gods as you stride across the land, shaping it to your will? Or a Bard who's stories will be told and retold across the generations?  
	The class you choose will influence how your character develops but it is not necessary to stay on that path as you progress.
	* See the [Basic Rules][Rules] for a list of the common classes and races but others are available.
* Family
	* Status (high-born, common, merchant etc.)
	* Is there a family trade
	* Do you have family members out in the world, is everyone you know and love blasted into tiny pieces?


As a Role Playing Game I highly encourage exercising a personality for your character.
Put on a voice/accent if you want, think about what your character would do in a situation and have fun with it.

If your character stops being fun, let us know.
We can either work out a way to bring back the excitement or you can create a new character which can be introduced at a suitable point (this may not be for a session or two though).

We will be available in the evenings before we start the campaign to assist with any questions, ideas and technical issues.

## Resources
### [Roll20]
We’ll be playing using the virtual tabletop [Roll20.net][Roll20] which will contain maps, your character sheets, creatures and people that you meet etc.
Most of the dice rolls you’ll need will also be point-and-click but one-off rolls are handled easily as well.

It is worth remembering that this is not a video game though.
What you see on-screen is an abstraction to help you visualise the world as you interact with it.
(Also I cannot guarantee the quality of the maps etc. as I’ll have to bodge some of them together myself).
</div>

### [Discord]
[Discord] is a voice (and video) chat service designed around games. There is a tiny bit of lag but it’s normally pretty reliable.
There are mobile and desktop apps on a bunch of platforms as well as a web client and I’d recommend some kind of headset if you can scrounge one up.
</div>

<div class="print-block" markdown="1">
### [Basic Rules][Rules]
[The Basic Rules PDF][Rules] is essential but you won’t have to read all of it. Read the *Introduction* and *How to Play* first then Parts 1 & 2.
Part 3 is only important if you want to be a magic user.

Any questions then let me know but the first session will be geared around getting used to the mechanics as well as establishing how you want to play your character.
</div>

<div class="print-block" markdown="1">
### Further Reading
[The Player’s Handbook][PHB] builds on the Basic Rules.
A digital copy, of sorts, will be available to you in Roll20 but if you wanted a copy of your own there are loads of places to get it, some with very different prices.
Ahem.
