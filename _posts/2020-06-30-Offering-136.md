My Queen,

We have come across a most troubled group of sea-dwellers whilst investigating a missing lighthouse in Bannock. The unfortunate creatures appear to be afflicted with some creeping malady that robs them of their faculties - it has made extraction of their experience challenging but I shall persevere. Most of them did not survive the encounter but I have performed the ritual preparations on their mortal remains.<!-- more --> It is possible that this affliction could be rooted in Bergvorn, being a smaller and more woe-begotten settlement to the east of Bannock, or perhaps the sea itself that links the two has given rise to the disparity in the fortunes of the inhabitants of these places.  
There is certainly a tone of dispair and rot carried under the iodine breeze and, I feel, some shameful stories to be recorded.

This new company I keep does not seem keen for me to be around them, I suspect my nature may be making them wary. Not to worry, they will give me what we need when their time comes. Until then I will observe and assist as I can.

Your ever-faithful Collector,  
Lia
