My Queen,

The Dretch were reluctant to resume their appropriate position but I believe were suitably persuaded as to the rightfulness of this action. The villager was restored to their prior condition without undue fuss and recounted the transformation of their childhood friend from man to Merrow as an offering to your grace - I trust that the impact of this experience suffices as payment.

After some investigation the group came to the rather wonderfully outlandish theory that the missing lighthouse, psychoactive slime and odd bitemarks found on a pair of bodies were linked to a colony of Kuo-Toa who had brought forth a protective deity from the lighthouse's structure and purpose. I believe I was quite pleasantly suprised when this turned out to be the truth; with your blessing I would like to have this experience for just a little bit longer.<!-- more -->

An attempt was made to parlay with the Kuo-Toa colony however the apparent gulf in world-view made anything more than rudimentary communication beyond my abilities. I profess I cannot even fathom whether their impressions of the world would satisfy your requirements, although this is entirely academic now as the colony has been erased. Perhaps this event will be a later source but, with this group, perhaps not.

Your ever-faithful Collector,  
Lia
