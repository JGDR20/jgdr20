    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">I have, over the last
    few years, had the pleasure of watching Pixie grow, from a
    design concept through to a finished locomotive. this has
    been thanks to occasional personal contact, and largely
    through the occasional articles submitted to MODEL ENGINEER
    magazine detailing progress to the latest stage.The author is
    a meticulous craftsman, with a well developed and organised
    workshop, each feature being installed as a result of
    considerable thought. That he has chosen to set out this
    account of his activities, revealing both the triumphs and
    difficulties encountered in the construction, is a tribute to
    his meticulous recording of his work.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Of all the books that
    I have read concerning the building of small locomotives,
    this one adopts a novel approach, taking as a starting point
    the actual workroom or other premises which are to be used
    for the work. Very often this is a facet of locomotive
    building which is neglected; leading to considerable problems
    later.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">I like the attention
    to detail, the account of the research needed to bring the
    product to fruition, the novel approach to pattern making,
    and the authors somewhat novel approach to gleaning much of
    the material needed.This is a very readable account of the
    building of a well detailed locomotive and, as importantly,
    the many hints and tips of a practical nature passed for the
    benefit of other constructors by the author.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">One can only applaud
    his industry in making the volume available in this fashion,
    I for one wish the volume every success.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">CHOICE OF PROTOTYPE</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WHY NARROW GAUGE?</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Choice of prototype.
    Space, weight and scale considerations. Location of track.
    Haulage and handling considerations. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Narrow gauge
    locomotives and rolling stock, as we in the United Kingdom
    know them, have a flavour of their own, quite removed from
    the nature of those of standard gauge railways. Historically
    narrow gauge lines, essentially light railways, have been
    quaint and often slow moving yet, in their own way efficient
    servants of the community. They and their dedicated staff
    have traditionally provided a personal, if somewhat erratic
    service, perhaps running in fits and starts, sometimes even
    stopping for an individual passenger at a field gate. History
    also records instances where the traveller has been required
    to assist in re-railing a piece of stock or in fetching water
    for the boiler!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Narrow gauge lines
    have a history of running on uneven, occasionally weed
    overgrown track. They take acute bends and steep gradients in
    their stride, rarely travelling at speeds exceeding 20 m.p.h.
    The locomotives are picturesque, often of short wheelbase,
    sometimes with with small boilers, tall chimneys, intricate
    weather plates and other interesting items of equipment. In
    some instances narrow gauge locomotives are festooned with
    'Victoriana' in the form of sandpots, polished plumbing and
    literally all manner of bells and whistles. Having said all
    that, we have to remember that on most continents there are
    narrow gauge (narrower than standard gauge that is)
    locomotives working over hundreds of miles of mountainous and
    inhospitable countryside. Such for example are the metre
    gauge railways of India and Malaya, and the South African and
    Ecuadorian Railways of 3 foot 6 inch gauge. In this book we
    concern ourselves with the narrower gauges and the smaller
    locomotives which have come to regarded in this country as
    the 'Norm' for narrow gauge.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There is a wide range
    of prototypes from which to make a selection. Firstly there
    are the conventional locomotives, often carrying out the
    duties of standard gauge locomotives over difficult terrain.
    Then there are tram locomotives, which worked in the
    industrial or urban environment, many of these are notable
    for their shrouded wheels and motion and controlled emissions
    of smoke and steam. They would be designed to be controlled
    from each end of the footplate, also hand and steam brakes
    would be compulsory. A number of tram locomotives were built
    with vertical boilers, an added touch of interest in model
    form. Vertical boilered locomotive models provide the builder
    with an opportunity to incorporate some previously built
    essay in model engineering, such as a Stuart Turner engine
    into their model. De Winton locomotives with vertical boilers
    and cylinders were virtually an engine platform with water
    tank, bunkers, reversing lever and brake standard. Inside and
    outside frame configurations were employed, also inside and
    outside drive, the latter by lay shaft and crank. R.A.S Abbot
    in his book on the topic describes how some locomotives
    carried the chimney directly above the boiler to avoid the
    formation of condensation and some locomotives were fired by
    sliding the fuel down chutes into the firebox located between
    the frames, plenty of scope here for the freelance modelmaker
    ! In an article in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 163 No.3859 October
    1989, Phil Atkinson gave the reader food for thought in his
    description of ' Coffee pot locomotives ' outshopped from
    Head Wrightsons Works in the late 1800's, with their heavily
    riveted vertical boilers and substantial wheelsets, these
    little locomotives would present a challenge, and a reward
    for the builder. A surprising feature of the locomtive was a
    one piece, cast iron frame incorporating main side members,
    buffer beams, the fuel bunker, all foot plates and the
    stiffening ribs, the whole described by Phil as a fine piece
    of the Victorian designers, pattern makers and iron founders
    art. No. 16 by the same builder even sports a rudimentary
    roof although one which would afford little protection to the
    driver !</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">For added spice,
    builders may turn their attention to innovative locomotives
    such as LOCOMOTIVE NO. 1 of the Listowel &amp; Ballybunnion
    Railway, straddling an early monorail. Double-bogied types
    such as those of the Festiniog Railway would present a
    challenge, or perhaps the modeller would wish to undertake a
    model of one of the the SHAYS or HEISLERS of the American
    short lines scene. Ken Swan's series on 'KOPPEL' a rack
    locomotive in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE could prompt the
    modeller to produce, for instance, a model of Locomotive
    Number 7 on the Snowdon Mountain Railway, although track
    construction would present a major challenge. Those seeking a
    simpler prototype would do well to build the locomotive Ross
    Harrison described commencing in ENGINEERING in MINIATURE,
    issue of September 1982, a convincing model in 5&quot; gauge
    based upon 'EDWARD THOMAS', Kerr Stuart 'Tattoo' Class
    locomotive built in 1921 for the Corris Railway, later moved
    to the the Talyllin Railway, a model full of atmosphere.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">For something really
    different the modeller might turn to the locomotives of a
    Dublin Brewery, designed by Samuel Geoghegan. These 1 foot 10
    inch gauge locomotives with cylinders and motion placed ABOVE
    the boiler were used in conjunction with haulage trucks into
    which they were hoisted for working the 5 foot 3 inch gauge.
    In this role the wheels of the locomotive rested on grooved
    rollers which propelled the trucks. Contractors locomotives
    make interesting prototypes and many model engineers have
    built 'SWEET PEA', designed along these lines by Jack
    Buckler. Some of these models exhibit remarkable
    modifications and there is scope for innovation. This
    locomotive would make an ideal test-bed for the model
    engineer who likes to experiment with features of his own
    design. Contractors locomotives provide a range of prototypes
    suited to modelling and it is a salutary thought that narrow
    gauge locomotives such as the Bagnall locomotive 'EXCELSIOR',
    a delightful little 0-4-0, were employed in much industrial
    construction as well as civil engineering works for railways.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A series of articles
    by Martin Evans in MODEL ENGINEER commencing in 1980
    described a free lance narrow gauge 0-4-0 Saddle Tank
    Locomotive, 'CONWAY'. This again was a blow-by-blow
    description and, as with all Martin Evans designs, examples
    of the completed model have been seen performing credibly on
    a many occasions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The modeller fortunate
    enough to locate the Armley Industrial Museum in Leeds can
    find there the beautifully preserved Hunslett narrow gauge
    locomotive 'JACK', resplendent in scarlet livery, lined in
    yellow and black. Built in 1898 for employment in a fireclay
    works near Burton-on Trent, 'JACK' is outside framed, has
    Baguley valve gear and masses of brass and copper in the
    steam dome and plumbing, with brass lubricators mounted on
    the smokebox. On top of the boiler are twin sand boxes and
    the loco has some nice details such as the hinged lights on
    the weather board and the drain pipes from the cylinders
    passing through the front beam. Running like a Rolls Royce it
    is a wonderful sight and one to make any model engineers
    pulse skip a beat. 'JACK' featured on the cover of MODEL
    ENGINEER Vol 158, No. 3798 April 1987 and a description of
    the locomotive appeared in that journal of October 1984</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Lest it be thought
    that narrow gauge locomotives are mainly of simple design
    there are many examples way and beyond 0-4-0 configuration as
    regards complexity. These will present just as much of a
    challenge as a standard gauge locomotive. For example there
    are the Manning Wardle &amp; Co. 2-6-2 side tank locomotives
    and the 2-4-2, Baldwin, 'LYN' of the Lynton and Barnstaple
    Railway. ('LEW' of this railway is, at the time of writing,
    being described in a construction series for 3 1/2 inch gauge
    in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE.) For the really adventurous
    constructor there are of course the 2-6-2 + 2-6-2 Garrats of
    the South African and Indian railways.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Decisions,
    decisions....!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The writer's decision
    to model PIXIE the Kerr Stuart ' Wren' Class locomotive
    KS4260 / 1922 was based upon several factors. First and
    foremost was the impression that the sight of the little
    locomotive as it coasted into Pages Park Station on the
    Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway one spring afternoon.
    It seemed incredible that a locomotive, produced initially
    for work on the installation of a sewer in 1922, should 60
    years later be found running like a Rolls-Royce and doing
    useful work in a domestic setting. Enquiries revealed a
    little of the history of the locomotive, the fact that after
    the completion of the Barkingside sewer contract it had for
    some years worked in the Wilmington Road Quarry of Devon
    County Council, eventually being purchased by the Industrial
    Locomotive Society and brought to Leighton Buzzard in the
    late 1960's. The locomotive has an overall length of
    something over 10 feet, it weighs 3 Tons 7 cwt empty, and 4
    tons 3 cwt in working order. The inside framed locomotive has
    Hackworth valve gear and is resplendent in an attractive
    livery of black, green and gold.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Here was a locomotive
    that was mechanically quite simple for a relative beginner to
    construct, It would be accessible for survey and was in the
    hands of friendly folk who were prepared to assist with
    provision of information. The railway was within 25 miles of
    home base, so that the survey could be staged over a series
    of visits. Above all, the locomotive had an atmosphere and
    charm which appeared to the writer to convey the very essence
    of narrow gauge railways. The decision has never been
    regretted and has, over the past ten years, opened up a whole
    new interest in the mechanical engineering of railways and of
    narrow gauge railways in particular. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At this stage the
    modeller intending to work in narrow gauge has to come to
    terms with the fact that just as much work will be involved
    in producing his chosen model as in producing one to run on
    standard gauge. Pixie was ten years in the building, through
    choice. Some things are too good to hurry and although one is
    always keen to get one's first locomotive onto the track,
    later efforts can be savoured, and perhaps greater attention
    paid to detail. In some instances such as for instance if a
    decision was made to model 'MERDDYN EMRYS', of Festiniog
    Railway fame, far more work could be involved. There could
    however be a saving in unit time in producing duplicate
    equipment, motion, tanks etc. In practice some builders do
    make locomotives in pairs and professionals make batches for
    just this reason. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SIZE</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Although construction
    of a sizeable standard gauge model locomotive may make
    excessive demands on the capacity of one's workshop and
    equipment, narrow gauge locomotives are generally simpler in
    design and, at the same scale, work up smaller in model form.
    ( This fact can be used to advantage by the modeller
    'moving-up' to a larger scale). The flavour of work and
    operations on a narrow gauge line can be replicated within a
    small workshop and in ones own backyard. Model engineering
    activities along narrow gauge lines' provide every
    opportunity for the incorporation into models of the very
    things that attract us to the prototype, to make and handle
    the artifacts that would otherwise, unless one works as a
    volunteer on a preserved line, be literally beyond reach. It
    should be remembered however that modelled on 5&quot; Gauge
    quite a small locomotive such as PIXIE, at some 10 feet
    overall, will be more than 25&quot; long in model form and of
    such dry weight that it is beyond one (normal) man's lifting
    ability! Quite apart from the weight of the model the
    physical size, 25&quot; long x 11.5&quot; wide by 20&quot;
    high are dimensions to be reckoned with when it comes to
    handling in the workshop and between shop and track! These
    details will not daunt the enthusiast however and ways and
    means are discussed later in this book.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SCALE CONSIDERATIONS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There are many factors
    to be considered when deciding upon the scale in which to
    model the chosen prototype. Whilst often one reads a
    statement that ' such and such a scale was chosen because of
    the equipment available on which to machine the parts' there
    is a lot more to be taken into consideration! Even a model of
    a small locomotive like PIXIE requires space for storage,
    maneuvering from storage to the track and general handling
    for maintenance and overhaul. In the case of Pixie it became
    necessary to build the hoist detailed in chapter xxx to carry
    out these simple exercises in comfort!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">One can comfortably
    carry out the machining operations for a 5&quot; Gauge narrow
    gauge locomotive on a lathe in the Myford, ' maid of all
    work' series, or some similar equipment. In case of need, one
    can often obtain assistance with larger components from a
    local engineering works or by enrolling at a local Evening
    Institute. Many trojans work on 7 1/4&quot; Gauge although
    here the parts, particularly the boiler assume relatively
    massive proportions. The enthusiast will tell you that these
    aspects are offset by the ride-in capability of their models
    and one can see their point of view. Access to a suitable
    track for running a 7 1/4&quot; locomotive is however likely
    to be beyond the reach of many people, depending of course
    upon geographical location. On the other hand, 3 1/2&quot;
    and 5&quot; Gauge tracks are generally accessible, the local
    club probably offers both facilities and one will not require
    a pantechnicon to get the locomotive there. 3 1/2&quot; gauge
    locomotives will fit easily into the family car as will some
    5&quot; gauge models, although larger locomotives on this
    gauge may require a purpose-made trailer. Narrow gauge locos
    for 5&quot; track can be loaded into an estate car, and at a
    pinch can be manhandled by two strong men. Models scaled to
    5&quot; gauge offer sturdiness of components capable of
    surviving such rigorous handling. There are numerous designs
    and details available. Over the years, blow by blow
    descriptions of the construction of such models have appeared
    in the model press. Narrow gauge on 3 1/2&quot; track can be
    ideal for a garden railway but for ride-behind fun the larger
    gauge has more to offer. In the case of a model such as
    Pixie, 2 1/2&quot; to the foot scale on 5&quot; gauge
    provides a stable ride, with a locomotive that has heft, and
    parts that are definitely out of the 'watchmaking' class! At
    this scale too the locomotive is robust, the firehole door
    whilst small provides a reasonable target for firing on the
    move and the levers and valves are sufficiently large to
    convey the feeling of the real thing in use.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TRACK LOCATION </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Of course the ideal
    track location must be around one's own garden. Few of us
    however, are fortunate enough to have sufficient space at our
    disposal, particularly for anything other than an
    out-and-back track. Having said that, the out-and-back track
    has its merits. It can be simple, relatively cheap to
    construct and lay, as well as providing a useful test
    facility. Whilst it would be grand to have a railway sweeping
    round the grounds, there is a lot to be said for 50' or so of
    portable track that can be laid down on the lawn or the
    terrace when required. Such a track avoids problems with
    landscaping and garden maintenance such as weeding and grass
    cutting. When the urge to steam a locomotive arises it is a
    simple matter to fetch the lengths of track from the shed or
    garage, lay them down, fasten a few fishplates, and be ready
    to run. One length of such track, carried into the workshop,
    will prove useful when setting valves and carrying out
    routine maintenance. Construction of a suitable track system
    is described and illustrated in a later Chapter.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The more fortunate may
    have space available which will permit a complete circuit,
    with perhaps a siding into a storage shed. This is not beyond
    the bounds of a medium sized backyard and one hears of 0-4-0
    locomotives happily negotiating 6 foot radius curves although
    it has to be said that the larger the radius the better.
    Certainly a small engine shed could be made to look most
    attractive and its location on the running ground would avoid
    a lot of effort that otherwise has to be expended in handling
    between steamings.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">HAULAGE AND HANDLING
    CONSIDERATIONS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Where there is
    sufficient space it is convenient to store the locomotive in
    the workshop. Failing this, perhaps a corner of the garden
    shed or garage can be set aside. It will prove helpful if the
    loco can be kept stored on a small trolley, Pixie's trolley
    is of Dexion angle, provided with a length of track and some
    stops to immobilise her in transit from the track to store
    and back. The trolley is described in Ch 17. Some splendid
    trolleys have been described in the model press from time to
    time. The modelmaker who intends to build up a locomotive
    stud, and take locomotives to club meets and similar events
    will do well to construct something similar to facilitate
    loading into the the car or van. One of the writer's
    acquaintances has a purpose-modified road trailer fitted with
    track on which two sizable locos can sit in transit, secured
    by bottle screws between strong points on the locomotives
    frames and the trailer body. Tool and coal storage is
    provided in the well of the trailer. The locomotives live on
    the trailer between meets and the trailer is ready for
    instant coupling to the family car, a good incentive to get
    out and about to meets and rallies. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As well as trolleys
    and trailers some ingenious hoists have been described in the
    model press, one hoist was designed to be coupled to the
    towing ball hitch on the back of a car for stability whilst
    lifting. The hoist used for handling Pixie, described later,
    is used to handle the locomotive in the workshop and at the
    garden track. It could be rendered more mobile by the
    insertion of splices in the leg frame to enable it to be
    transported by car. If this was done the original 'test
    load', two and a half bags of cement would be called into
    action once again to prove the mechanics. Hoisting a
    locomotive calls for a custom-built spreader bar to ensure
    that no damage is suffered in the course of a lift, and time
    spent getting the correct balance of the locomotive whilst
    suspended on such a spreader will ensure safety. </font></p>

    Research. Manufacturers drawings. Commercially available
    designs. Value of the model press, exhibitions and club
    membership.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">ESTABLISHING DETAIL</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The amount of research
    required will depend upon whether the modeller chooses to
    produce an accurate scale model, or a near scale model. In
    the former case a massive amount of detail will be necessary,
    to the point of the sometimes derided ' rivet counting'
    exercise '. To embark on a scale model of a locomotive from
    'scratch' is to commit oneself to many months and perhaps
    years of work. For the scale modeller every detail has
    significance, every modification to the original design has
    be faithfully reproduced and incorporated into the model. The
    problem here is that the components may prove to be too
    delicate to stand up to service on the track and there has to
    be a temptation towards some judicious beefing-up of parts.
    Fortunately if the choice is a narrow-gauge model on 5 inch
    gauge track the various components will work up to be quite
    substantial and durable in use.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The near scale
    modeller whilst perhaps taking a more relaxed approach to
    detail has nevertheless to convey the atmosphere of prototype
    through the parts that he does include. He is fortunate in
    having the opportunity to make parts a little more solidly
    than they would be in true scale and thus a little less
    vulnerable to damage on the track. As we have said before
    modelling is a very personal process. Whatever the degree of
    scale accuracy is decided upon, careful research is required.
    The word</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">' Research ' sounds
    quite impressive. In fact it really describes a process that
    every enthusiast follows naturally in the course of enjoying
    his hobby, that of ferreting out detail on a topic which he
    finds interesting. The sources of information are many and
    varied, ranging from contact with individuals having personal
    knowledge of the topic, manufacturers, museum archives,
    libraries, railway sites, Model Engineering Societies and
    Preservation Societies. Once one's mind is set on a
    particular prototype there seems no end to the sources of
    information. The only problem is that in the back of one's
    mind there is always always the feeling that some source is
    being overlooked. The modeller may rest assured however, if
    there is some inaccuracy or anachronism, someone with expert
    knowledge will probably put him right at time of the models
    first public appearance!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">MANUFACTURERS DRAWINGS
    AND PHOTOGRAPHS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We may be fortunate
    enough to have a sight of manufacturers drawings, if not
    directly, at second hand. Many of the books on narrow-gauge
    railways shew illustrations of these drawings which can be
    worked-up for use as detail in constructing a model.
    Photographs of locomotives in the outshopped state are an
    institution. No manufacturer ' worthy of his salt' would have
    outshopped a locomotive and sent it away to his customer
    without having it photographed in its pristine state. These
    photographs are worth their weight in gold to the
    enthusiastic model engineer who can enlarge detail and glean
    useful information for model making purposes. Failing works
    drawings or manufacturers photographs, the authors of many of
    the series of construction articles published in the model
    press base their work and the drawings accompanying the text
    on detail taken from manufacturers drawings. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Some books such as
    those on narrow-gauge lines noted in the bibliography
    include, as appendices, quite detailed drawings of the
    locomotives and stock of the lines they describe. When
    supplemented by detail derived from the photographic
    illustrations, these small scale drawings can provide
    sufficient detail for the model engineer wishing to produce a
    near scale model. Typical of these, and on the face of things
    an unlikely source book i s ' Narrow Gauge Railway Modelling
    ' by D A Boreham. Intended for workers in 7mm scale this book
    includes nicely produced general assembly drawings of such
    locomotives as Locomotives 1 &amp; 2 of the Festiniog Railway
    and 'Mary' by W. G. Bagnall as worked by Cliffe Hill Granite
    Company. The book ' The Lynton and Barnstable Railway
    1895-1935' by L.T. Catchpole includes works line drawings of
    the three Manning and Wardle locomotives and the Baldwin
    which reveal essential detail for the modelmaker.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Over the years some
    excellent, and generally quite accurate, outline drawings
    have been published in the model railway press devoted to 4mm
    and similar scale modelling. These drawings provide a basis
    for an excellent model when used in conjunction with standard
    details of parts gleaned from the pages of MODEL ENGINEERING
    and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE and such standard works as LBSCs
    ' Shop Shed and Road ' and Martin Evans ' Manual of Model
    Steam Locomotive Construction '. Whilst in the main these
    books cater for the modeller working on standard gauge,
    mechanical principles do not vary from those of the narrower
    gauge. As discussed earlier much of narrow-gauge mechanical
    engineering is of a simpler design than that of the big stuff
    but there is no reason why, within the ' innards ' of a
    narrow gauge locomotive, one should not employ more advanced
    methods.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">RESEARCH </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A visit to the local
    library will reveal a wealth of publications touching upon
    the subject of narrow-gauge railway operations, locomotives
    and rolling stock. A brief perusal of the advertisements in
    the model press will serve to remind us of the considerable
    number of books available for purchase. A search of the stock
    on the bookstall at the next model railway exhibition will
    yield a surprising amount of information which is specific to
    narrow gauge. In the run-up to commencing a model, it is
    worthwhile copying or noting for reference material likely to
    be useful when the work begins. Often one encounters
    photographs showing useful detail in the most unlikely
    places. Newspapers, magazines, guide books and holiday
    advertisements have all yielded useful data in their time.
    The writer with his interest in sketching and drawing decided
    to measure from the prototype, meanwhile enjoying the visits
    to the line and contact with the volunteers working on the
    stock there. This may not be a feasible approach for many and
    other means of establishing detail become imperative.
    Brochures, postcards, and some posters for the Leighton
    Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway provided photographs, which were
    of immense value in confirming detail achieved from survey.
    The modeller will do well to seek out similar details of his
    projected prototype.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Researching a model
    can be tremendous fun. Recent research took the writer to an
    industrial museum in the Midlands to meet a voluntary
    archivist. Working in the bowels of the museum this
    gentleman, a volunteer with years of experience within the
    engineering industry, specific to locomotive design and
    construction behind him, spends his time cataloguing works
    drawings saved from destruction at the time of the demise of
    an internationally known manufacturer. He has become known to
    many enthusiasts and is constantly called upon to supply
    information on requests from correspondents all over the the
    world. In fact, so busy are he and a colleague, that they
    cannot publicise their facilities in case excess demand
    should bring their activities to a halt! Perhaps in the
    course of research the reader will be fortunate enough to
    meet similar kind folk. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">COMMERCIAL DESIGNS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">During the past 20
    years there have been many series of articles on the
    construction of narrow-gauge locomotives, notable are those
    on the construction of CONWAY, a freelance narrow-gauge 0-4-0
    Saddle Tank locomotive for 3 1/2 inch gauge by Martin Evans,
    in MODEL ENGINEER of 1980. Other practical designs are the
    freelance model ' SWEET PEA ' mentioned earlier in this book
    and described in a series of articles in ENGINEERING IN
    MINIATURE. Whilst such designs are initially prepared for the
    benefit of the readers of the journal, commercial concerns
    soon set themselves up to provide the necessary materials and
    particularly castings for featured locomotives. In this way
    the modeller gains the advantage of an economic supply of raw
    materials and is, should he so wish, relieved of the work of
    producing his own patterns</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The model engineer
    should not overlook designs for which part, or fully
    machined, sets of parts are available, particularly as these
    models have been built in large numbers and have proved
    themselves as runners on tracks throughout the world. Kits of
    ready machined parts such as those available from Messrs
    MAXITRACK have served to introduce many modellers to the
    delights of model engineering. Once having assembled a model
    from a set of parts, production and assembly of ones own
    parts seems just a small step to take. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THE MODEL PRESS,
    PUBLICATIONS, EXHIBITIONS AND CLUB MEMBERSHIP</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As will be evidenced
    by the frequent references in this book, the writer is an
    avid reader of a number of model engineering publications.
    These range from MODEL ENGINEER and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE
    to the excellent series of publications by such firms as
    ARGUS BOOKS and THE OAKWOOD PRESS. Magazines devoted to
    specialised topics such as small scale railway modelling have
    information to offer. It is well worth taking time to note
    articles which contain detail which can prove useful at some
    later date, a note of the magazine or source made in the
    diary or logbook can save hours of searching later.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Most of the existing
    narrow gauge railways have a bookshop at the main depot as do
    industrial museums up and down the country. Stocks within
    these shops often contain valuable information for the
    would-be modeller, most for example have some write-up of the
    history of the line and its equipment, or in the case of
    museums a description of a specific locomotive exhibit,
    containing valuable illustrations. Picture postcards and
    posters are another source of information and with care can
    be used to supplement surveys and drawings.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">National and Local
    Exhibitions provide an opportunity for contact with trade
    suppliers, and other enthusiasts who can provide leads on
    sources of information. The models exhibited often reveal
    useful detail, and contact with the producer can assist in
    extending ones knowledge of methods and techniques. There is
    often a stand where known experts give demonstrations and
    provide advice on problems. Bookstalls at exhibitions can
    provide a useful source of information, on occasions it has
    been possible to pick up a years back numbers of journals for
    quite reasonable sums, reasonable when one considers the
    wealth of information contained therein.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Club membership has a
    great deal to offer, particularly where the newcomer to model
    engineering is concerned. There is never any shortage of
    know-how or advice. Frequently one or other of the members is
    specialist in or has specific knowledge of a particular
    railway, having perhaps worked on the line or more recently
    done voluntary work in preservation. Club membership may well
    present other advantages such as access to machines and
    services and sometimes discounted prices on materials from a
    local supplier. Local club programmes often include talks and
    demonstrations by visiting speakers, specialist in some
    branch of model making such as boilermaking, painting and so
    on, these events are particularly beneficial to the beginner.

    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">GOING IT ALONE </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As we have seen there
    are many drawings available for narrow gauge locomotives,
    quite a number of kits of castings and indeed, even sets of
    parts for home assembly. It is however quite likely that the
    modeller has a particular prototype in mind, one that has
    fired his imagination, one that brings back fond memories
    from the past, or perhaps a locomotive to which access can be
    gained. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Where the prototype is
    one of the many that have passed on to the ' great engine
    shed in the sky' then some research will be required. Indeed,
    research of some order will be required whatever the reason
    behind the choice of a specific prototype. We are fortunate
    that the history of steam and steam railways in particular
    has been so thoroughly recorded by many devoted writers over
    the years, these constitute major works and will prompt
    further reading as a particular topic is followed up. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SURVEYING A PROTOTYPE </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The cover of MODEL
    ENGINEER Vol 158 No 3795 Feb 1987 illustrates 'Rishra' and
    'Challoner' of the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. The
    remarks of the Editor of MODEL ENGINEER, Ted Jolliffe who
    took the photograph are apposite. He writes,' This shot was
    taken on one of the best days of last Summer at Pages Park
    Station, home of the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. '
    Rishra ' and ' Challoner ' pose together after double heading
    a Special Train, a charming sight and one which could well
    cause many modellers to dash to the railway armed with
    camera, ruler and sketch pad' ........ We know the feeling! </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">If one is fortunate
    enough to have access to the chosen prototype there are a
    number of things to consider in achieving sufficient detail
    for the construction of a convincing model. The locomotive
    may be sited on a preserved line, in a museum or may even be
    standing in derelict condition in a scrap yard. The important
    thing is to secure access. The first step will be an approach
    to the controller of a preserved line, the curator of a
    museum or the proprietor of a scrap yard. Permission to
    survey the prototype is generally given although there may be
    some stipulations regarding access times and so on. The thing
    uppermost in the minds of those in authority will be that of
    safety, both that of the visitor and those who work the line
    or run the museum. This is understandable in these days when
    responsibility and the rights of the individual are assuming
    such importance in life. It is essential that any visitor
    makes his presence known to those in charge in order that
    this safety can be preserved in the case of engine, stock or
    plant movements. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In the case of a
    locomotive preserved in a museum, one may be fortunate enough
    to find that drawings already exist, more than likely the
    curator or some enthusiast will have done some research
    already and will be prepared provide valuable information. In
    the case of a preserved locomotive it is likely that the line
    is in possession of at least some drawings from which copies
    or at least major dimensions may be taken. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In the case of PIXIE
    it was decided to make a complete survey, starting from
    scratch as described in this chapter. Where drawings or key
    dimensions are available, a lot of what is described can be
    omitted but in the interests of achieving a model of
    character it is advisable that, where possible, a visit or
    visits are made to the prototype for the purpose of achieving
    accuracy, and observing details that have either resulted
    from rebuilding or preservation work. Some detail changes are
    brought about simply by repair of wear and tear, or changes
    in the demands made upon the loco in service. For example,
    some small details such as the loops of tow that are used to
    lubricate the valve rods on PIXIE, the diesel couplers that
    were mounted for some years, the changes to the rear weather
    plate and the replacement of the riveted tank by one of
    welded construction with imitation rivets have been
    incorporated in the model to good advantage. We did not,
    however, incorporate the differences between wheels that have
    resulted from refurbishment over the years! </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At an early stage it
    becomes necessary to decide on a ' base date' for the model.
    In the case of Pixie this was set as the date on which we
    first saw the locomotive. As well as the base date, the state
    in which the model is to be presented has to be determined.
    It takes a strong character to produce a model locomotive in
    pristine condition and then render it into a weathered
    condition! Mostly, we like to see our models in an outshopped
    state and not exhibiting the ravages of service. I decided to
    model Pixie as though she had just undergone a face-lift in
    the paint department but incorporating all the detail that I
    saw that magic day when I first saw her glide into Pages Park
    Station on the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Having decided on the
    prototype it is time to start on the survey. I was fortunate
    to have the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway ' on the
    doorstep '. I had visited this line on a number of occasions
    and been struck by the friendly manner of all the volunteers
    who work the line. Not for nothing has the railway won its
    name as ' The friendly little line'. I gathered all the
    information I could from their publicity leaflets, and
    obtained some attractive posters, one of which showed my
    chosen prototype PIXIE the Kerr Stuart ' Wrenn ' Class saddle
    tank locomotive, built in 1922. The poster still adorns one
    wall in the workshop. This illustration and the memory of our
    first encounter acted as a spur to my efforts over the years.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At the Railway I soon
    established that the volunteers, among them the taxman, the
    accountant, the telecom engineer and a number of other
    interesting characters, were all pleased to help in any way
    they could. Access to the workshop was given by the
    Controller. Drivers, firemen and other functionaries took the
    greatest of pleasure in responding to my sometimes naive
    questions. I was able to time my visits to coincide with
    occasions when the locomotive was shedded for normal
    maintenance and repair, and one notable occasion when the
    boiler was to be subjected to inspection and test by the
    Insurance Inspector. Take time to develop a good relationship
    with the staff of your selected prototypes' line then you are
    sure to be accorded the same privileges. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you may be
    fortunate enough to obtain copies of the works drawings from
    the manufacturer, or you may have gleaned sufficient
    information to build your model from your research. In the
    first case you will only have to scale down the detail, in
    the second you will need to prepare sufficient detail for
    construction planning and parts manufacture. In the case of
    Pixie sketches were produced from site measurements, not
    finished drawings but simple line drawings to be worked from
    at the various stages of construction. Examples of these
    sketches can be seen in the accompanying illustrations. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Plan the survey work.
    You can only make so many measurements in each session!
    Sometimes you will need a friend to hold the tape or direct
    the torch. You can't always bother the locals who are busy
    with their maintenance and restoration tasks. It is helpful
    to pre-prepare sketches from photographs so that you can
    enter the dimensions as you measure, failing this produce
    sketches on the spot. Bold outline sketches are best, it is
    difficult to sketch, measure and insert dimensions all at the
    same time. It is also difficult to convey to another person
    just what dimensions you are calling-off, so wherever
    possible enter the numbers yourself. On return to base, and
    as working sketches are prepared, make notes of any
    dimensions that are missing, these will be the first
    measurements to be taken on the next site visit. Do not be
    dismayed if on the first visit ( or two ) you miss some
    details, you will find with practice that you become more
    observant, and more inquisitive. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">EQUIPMENT FOR THE
    SURVEY </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Each individual will
    have differing ideas on the gear required for the preparation
    of measured details from a prototype. The equipment used by
    the author, whilst varying from visit to visit, included the
    following items;- </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Clipboard, pencil (s)
    and paper, eraser, pencil sharpener or knife, measuring tape,
    steel rule, torch and a set square, ( on most occasions the
    edges of the clipboard sufficed) </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Camera and flash
    equipment, preferably a single lens reflex model although
    todays compact cameras, with their built-in flash and zoom
    facilities provide excellent photographs. Dare we mention
    spare film! </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Most of these items
    can be carried in a knapsack or some similar bag, nothing too
    special should be used as it is likely to accumulate its
    share of steam oil or grease! Mention of oil and grease
    brings to mind the need for a supply of ' Swarfega ' or some
    similar de-greasant, a bottle of water and an old towel. Not
    all loco sheds have supplies of such basic needs! </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A SYSTEM OF WORKING </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It is always advisable
    to phone the site prior to a visit, both to confirm that you
    may have access to the locomotive and to establish where it
    is to be found on the day, also what state it will be in. It
    is also useful to know how to dress for the visit, some days
    are 'clean' days and some decidedly dirty! </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now for taking the
    actual measurements. It is best to start by making simple
    sketches of the key items to be measured in the course of a
    visit, say a front beam, back plate or frame member. It makes
    good sense to keep groups of details on separate sheets, even
    at the risk of duplicating some detail. This will make
    reference to detail of particular parts of the locomotives
    easier in the workshop when a specific sheet of details can
    be isolated for reference. This also facilitates filing of
    the results of the survey, speeding the process of
    identifying dimensions. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Try to make each
    sketch to the same proportions as the member to be measured,
    later this will be facilitated by the use of photographs in
    producing sketches on which the dimensions can be set out. It
    is advisable to take running dimensions from a datum point
    thus avoiding inaccuracies due to the build up of small
    differences in measurement. In the absence of a helping hand,
    running dimensions can be taken single-handed by clamping one
    end of the tape to the feature forming the datum, and reading
    the tape at each point of interest ( remembering to pull the
    tape taut as each reading is taken, and ensuring that it is
    not snagged on some projection! ) Where taking details of
    groups of items such as bolts or rivets these should be
    sketched and measured, and the running dimension taken to a
    key point in the group. The individual rivet heads or bolts
    positions can then be related to this key point, and set out
    accordingly when interpreting the sketches back at base. At
    this stage with the tape in position, a photograph will
    reinforce the dimensions being noted. When the time comes to
    translate the detail the photo will serve as a reminder of
    odd little points which whilst clear on site fade in the mind
    between whiles. Things that are easily overlooked are
    material thicknesses, bolt, nut and washer sizes. Whilst
    measuring the plane surfaces it is also necessary to note
    such detail as plate thicknesses, pipe diameters, bolt and
    rivet head sizes and shapes. Where there are details such as
    cranked plates and coupling rods, dimensions of offsets have
    to be noted.. Sets in plate, or changes in plane, and similar
    detail which are critical to the overall appearance and '
    atmosphere ' of the finished model should be noted and '
    scrap ' sketches made for future reference. These scrap or
    local details are most useful in interpreting the overall
    picture presented by the dimensioned sketches. Brief notes
    help too, a note regarding colour, texture or material f some
    feature will save valuable time at a later date. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">ONGOING VISITS </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After the first visit
    it may be possible to mark up dimensions onto sketches taken
    from photographs or from slides, the former by tracing from a
    large print of a subject set upon a light box, alternatively
    on a sheet of glass or perspex placed over some suitable form
    of illumination such as a table lamp. Transparencies can be
    projected at a suitable size onto a piece of paper taped to
    the workshop wall and tracings made for use on the next visit
    to site. Judicious scaling of the projected picture will
    ensure that sufficient space is available for the insertion
    of dimensions at site. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At the commencement of
    a follow-up visit it is essential that outstanding queries
    are cleared up. This may necessitate further measurement or
    some discussion with a local, be he a curator, or a volunteer
    in the case of preserved locomotives. A point of caution
    here, enthusiasts can be very helpful but.....their memories
    are tinctured by their personal interests and any two taken
    together may come up with different opinions regarding when
    such and such a detail was modified or a particular feature
    added. In the course of conversations it is worth while
    listening for local ' intelligence ' such as a forthcoming '
    shopping ' of the prototype or perhaps a boiler inspection.
    Visits timed to coincide with such events, with permission,
    will provide opportunities for examining the inner workings
    of the locomotive, the valve chests and boiler tube
    arrangements, blower ring and so on which would otherwise
    prove difficult when the loco is in service. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When working on the
    survey it is advisable to visualise how the model parts will
    be constructed, whether they will be machined from castings
    or fabricated. Whilst this does not affect the dimensions
    needed it does assist when the fabrication commences in the
    workshop. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THE 'DATABASE' </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Information achieved
    at site will form the basis for some months and in some
    cases, some years of effort in the workshop so that on return
    to base it becomes necessary to store the details from survey
    in such a manner that they can be recovered at will. All
    rough sketches made at site should be retained, possibly in a
    box file. Photographs and file cards can be stored in boxes
    and slides filed in the containers in which they are returned
    from processing. It is advisable, in order to save time
    later, to segregate details under various headings such as '
    Backhead', ' Smokebox' etc. Ideally, general assembly
    photographs will serve to tie the various items together and
    indicate the relationships of the individual subsections.
    During the course of constructing the model of PIXIE more
    than 180 photographs were taken in the form of transparencies
    and some 100 pages of notes and sketches were assembled.
    These are still retained today and act as a reminder when
    some adjustment or modification becomes necessary. Between
    visits and when not engaged in making parts in the workshop,
    some redrawing of details can assist in clarifying detail. It
    is advisable always to retain original sketches although they
    may have been superceded by a more recent, perhaps tidier
    sketch. There is often a need to return to the original to
    recap on some note or sketch made at the site. In this
    context it is advisable to make notes of details that present
    themselves during the survey, Where lock nuts are used, the
    position of a cotter pin and so on, later in the workshop one
    does not want to attempt feats of memory to establish what
    one saw months or years before. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDS </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now we have digital
    photography and can wiew the images we take at whatever size
    is required on computer screen</font><font size="5"
    face="Comic Sans MS">. </font><font size="4"
    face="Comic Sans MS">Archiving is a simple matter and
    referencing simpler still. It still pays to take addition
    trouble to include tape and rules to enable sizes to be
    established back at base and special care over lighting to
    reveal the inner workings of the machanics of our subject.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Often there are
    posters and similar material which can yield useful
    information, as well as postcards perhaps, on sale at a kiosk
    illustrating our subject in earlier days.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The Internet provides
    a fund of images of virtually every locomotive that ever
    existed, simple to download and readily sizable on our
    computer, and again simple to archive.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It should al;ways be
    remembered that permission should be sought to photographon
    site. Safety arrangements have to be observed and also care
    should be taken regarding copyright of images from the web</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WORKSHOP, TOOLS AND
    EQUIPMENT</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This chapter ought
    really to be entitled ' Tools, equipment and workshop'
    because, whilst many books on the topic set out initially to
    describe in some detail the workshop facilities required, in
    practice the first requirement is some tools. The next
    requirement is some mechanical equipment and eventually a
    workshop, or rather a workplace! Of course it is ideal if one
    has a dedicated space in which to work, a place where
    everything can remain undisturbed between sessions, but it is
    a lucky man indeed who can start with such a space available.
    A great deal of work has been done in what were on the face
    of things, quite unlikely situations, in a first floor flat,
    in a roof space, onboard ship and countless other such
    awkward or uncomfortable places. At one time the writer made
    models on a fold-down bench sited, of all places, in the
    toilet ! Then followed a move to the loft via. the kitchen
    table and eventually, some years later it became possible to
    build an extension to the house and set up a formal workshop.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A great deal of useful
    work can be done simply by using hand tools, small parts
    being turned in an electric drill. Occasional access to a
    lathe and drill press, made possible perhaps by enrollment in
    an evening class or by ' chatting- up ' the maintenance
    engineer at one's place of work can bring the opportunity to
    progress further in the hobby. Several of the stationary
    engines which provided the basis of the author's model
    engineering experience were fabricated piece-part fashion
    using such facilities..... ........Maintenance engineers
    often turn out to be steam enthusiasts at heart!<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The pleasure to be
    obtained from our hobby can be realised in a number of ways.
    One of these revolves around pride in possessing the
    necessary tools for the job, sometimes obtained as a result
    of some sacrifice such as giving up smoking, or forgoing some
    other pleasure. There is also the satisfaction to be taken
    from achieving something which would normally be considered
    beyond the scope of the simple equipment which we may have
    acquired. Whilst other delights of model engineering have
    been touched upon earlier in the book, the challenge of
    achieving, what once may have seemed to be if not impossible,
    extremely difficult, using available equipment and facilities
    still features heavily in the enjoyment stakes! <br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TOOLS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Tools are a joy,
    however acquired either purchased in pristine condition from
    a first class tool shop or from other sources such as garage
    or car-boot sales, possibly in need of renovation. The tools
    that give the greatest pleasure are often those passed on to
    us from relatives or friends. Tools may have been handed down
    from departed relatives and considerable pleasure can be
    obtained as using them prompts remembrance.. Use on the
    current project prompts thoughts of the original owner, such
    as the old tool maker who on his retirement made us a present
    of his micrometer and other measuring tackle. As experience
    grows the modeller will probably design and make some special
    tools, these are particularly precious in meeting an
    identified need and are special to the maker.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It is important to buy
    the best tools that can be afforded, they will if properly
    maintained probably outlive us and be passed on to sons (and
    daughters). Where possible, a workshop set of tools should be
    maintained as distinct from the general kit used in the
    garage and on DIY work about the house and garden. When a
    loan is requested, lend from the general kit! Mainly tools
    are acquired as the need arises although most of us will have
    to admit to making purchases on an impulse, particularly at
    the magical MODEL ENGINEER EXHIBITION where there is the
    opportunity of making some fantastic purchases. It makes
    sense to go to the exhibition with a shopping list of items
    necessary to bring tool stocks up to standard, it offers a
    grand opportunity for replacing broken small items such as
    taps and drills. It is very difficult to withstand the urge
    to snap up bargains and indeed often return with such '
    bargains ', perhaps wondering what prompted the purchase yet
    secure in the knowledge that they will come in useful one day
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">!MEASURING TACKLE AND
    INSTRUMENTS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Apart from the
    aforementioned micrometer the following equipment, listed in
    order of aquisition, meets all the requirements of model
    making on models up to 5&quot; gauge:-</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Good quality steel
    rules in 300 and 150 mm lengths, squares of various sizes,
    inside and outside calipers, oddleg caliper, 0-150mm vernier
    caliper gauge, height gauge, mm dial gauge, surface plate (
    mine is 250 x 200mm obtained second hand ), magnetic stand
    for dial gauge also various scribers. Although the sizes are
    quoted in millimetres the workshop still boasts a set of
    Imperial equipment and much of the work is carried out in '
    dear old ' feet and inches. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Later additions to the
    outfit include some inside micrometers, obtained secondhand,
    a centre finder, a wiggler set for edge and centre-finding,
    pair of vee blocks and a huge, ex-WD, caliper, purchased for
    a song in an open market. A dial caliper gauge ( the pride of
    my life, bought as a bargain at the MODEL ENGINEER EXHIBITION
    ) is in constant use. As model engineers rather than
    engineers, much of our work involves working to fits rather
    than critical dimensions. The dial caliper provides a speedy
    yet sufficiently accurate means of comparing sizes whether
    internal, external or depth. The current generation of
    digital gauges are of course even more dynamic to use and
    will prove to be worth the ' arm and a leg ' they may cost.
    The great advantage is that these instruments can be zeroed
    at any dimension and thus directly indicate differences
    between measurements.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A recent aquisition, a
    magnetic-based holder for a dial gauge, has proved extremely
    useful. It is used the course of turning, milling and
    drilling to measure tool feeds. With the base set onto the
    machine bed and the magnet actuated, a dial gauge can be set
    to bear against a table or slide such that the travel or
    depth of feed can be directly read from the gauge as work
    proceeds. It is far easier in some cases to read the gauge
    thus set-up, than it is to read the micrometer dial on the
    machine. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">HAND TOOLS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The number and type of
    tools that one uses is a very personal thing, excellent
    models are built by some modellers equipped with what could
    be regarded as the absolute minimum of tools.<br>
    It is preferable as far as possible to have the correct tool
    for the job, sometimes to the extent of 'overkill'!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Again in the order of
    aquisition the following tools have permitted the production
    of a series of models up to 5&quot; gauge:-</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An assortment of saws
    including 'senior' and 'junior' hacksaws and a coping saw.
    Hammers, ball pein, claw and pin, also a builders lump hammer
    for persuasion of heavy sections! An assortment of files and
    some rasps. A short set of ( expensive ) jewelers files have
    proved invaluable Pliers of assorted shape also a pair of
    steelfixers ' nips ' and two sizes of tin snips, one having
    curved blades. Chisels, punches of various sizes and an '
    automatic ' centre punch. A wheel brace and an electric
    drill, later supplemented by the aquisition of a high speed
    mini-drill and variable speed control. A variety of clamps
    include ' Mole ' overlever clamps, 'G' clamps and a range of
    tool makers clamps. A hot-glue gun has proved useful,
    particularly for locating small or thin parts during
    machining operations! Screwdrivers include the good old '
    engineers pattern driver, electrical and watchmakers
    screwdrivers. Several adjustable spanners are used,for rough
    work but for actual work on models only good quality open
    ended, or socket spanners are used. Messrs Proop's ' Doofers
    ' come in useful at many stages.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Drill bitts have been
    purchased over the years to the stage where number sizes are
    supported as are Imperial and letter sizes to about 1 /
    2&quot; diameter maximum. Taps and dies have been purchased
    as the need has arisen and most sizes from 9 BA to 1 /
    2&quot; are held, together with the necessary stocks and
    tapholders.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TOOL STORAGE</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Tools are stored on
    boards, either wall mounted or, in the case of small tools,
    fixed as riser boards on the back edge of the benches. The
    location of tools on these boards is determined by the place
    in which they are most often used, chuck keys adjacent to the
    drills, tommy bars adjacent to the mill, small tools adjacent
    to the clean bench and so on. Tools which see only occasional
    use are stored in file trays picked up cheaply in a car boot
    sale. Portable power tools and lathe accessories are sited in
    cabinets, again wall-mounted, with glass doors to ward off
    the ever present workshop dust.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">BENCHES</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Bench height is a very
    personal thing, the vices must be at the right height for
    filing and sawing operations, in the writers case 32 inches
    from floor level, yet for very fine work it is often
    necessary to have them higher as does a watchmaker. This is
    achieved by having a supplementary worktop which rest on the
    standard bench and can be secured when necessary by clamps,
    or mounted in the vices.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Within the workshop it
    seems that one can never have enough benches or worktops.
    Just as it is sometimes said that ' work expands to fill time
    ', so things multiply to fill workspace ! Nearly 2 / 3 rds of
    the perimeter of the workshop is allocated to worktops or
    benches. Some discipline has to be maintained here, one bench
    is the ' dirty bench ', one the ' clean bench ' and the other
    the light, mobile bench. The first two speak for themselves,
    although there is a need for strong discipline to keep the
    clean bench, used for electronics and fine work, really clean
    ! The dirty bench is for the heavy work of preparing metal
    for machining.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The mobile bench is a
    recent production, made from DEXION angle, it is set to match
    the height of the fixed benchwork and can be used in its own
    right for light fabrication work, or appended to the fixed
    benches to accomodate overlong pieces of work. The castors
    are of the heavy industrial type and are set so that the
    uprights of the assembly just clear the floor. When any
    particularly heavy task is to be undertaken it is a matter
    only of a few seconds work to insert thin wedges to take the
    strain off the castors. The bench is used for final assembly
    of clean items and can be sited according to the work in
    hand, against the lathe as a repository for tools between
    uses or adjacent to the benches as required. It is useful to
    have space to 'park' small tools in the course of work, to
    hand yet not cluttering the available worktop. A particular
    advantage to be gained from a mobile bench is that, sited in
    the right place in the workshop, it provides a base on which
    a length of portable track can be mounted for service work,
    adjustments to the loco and so on. A short length of 3/4 inch
    plywood is used to bridge between the fixed and mobile
    benches and access is available all round the 'island' so
    formed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">VICES</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Vices are mounted on
    secondary pieces of benchtop which allow their location to be
    changed to suit the work in hand. The heavy ply bases for the
    vices were drilled to template, as were the benchtops and it
    is a matter of a few minutes work to change things around as
    required whether for heavy or light work, working in wood,
    metal or plastics. As well as the normal duties of holding
    metal for sawing, filing etc. the two metalworking vices
    mounted in tandem are used for folding and bending plate
    materials. There is a woodworking vice, this swivels and has
    the useful facility of reversible jaws which permit gripping
    material up to 7 inches wide. Cramps include toolmakers,
    mole, screwclamps as used in woodworking and some excellent
    clamps which whilst intended to be used as screw clamps can
    if supplemented by a 3/4&quot; stock bar be used in clamping
    lengths limited only by the available bar. 'Grippery' is
    competed by a small parts, universal vice built to a design
    published in MODEL ENGINEER, this is invaluable for small
    part assembly and the investment of the 2 or 3 hours expended
    in its construction has been repaid many times over. <br>

    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">MACHINE TOOLS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The King of the
    workshop in these scales is without doubt the Myford 7 series
    lathe. We graduated to this from a Unimat via a very ancient
    but extremely trusty Zyto lathe, purchased second-hand which
    was used in building a series of Stuart Turner stationary
    engines. The Myford is equipped with 3 and 4 jaw chucks,
    faceplate, and a swiveling vertical table. Drill chucks to 1
    / 2&quot; and a home- built die holder for the tailstock
    complete the lathe equipment proper although a number of
    accessories have been built including boring and knurling
    tools, wobblers, height gauges and so on from descriptions in
    MODEL ENGINEER over the years.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The first exercise
    with the Myford was the construction of a sensitive drill to
    a design from Messrs Reeves catalogue. The necessary castings
    and raw metal were purchased from Reeves and provided
    excellent practice in turning, boring and so on. The parts
    worked-up into an extremely accurate piece of workshop
    equipment which allows the use of the smallest number drills
    without breakages. With small number drills it is important
    that one gets the 'feel' of the drill as it cuts metal,
    particularly at the critical time just before and at break
    through, the Reeves drill provides just that feel. One
    addition ,in the interests of safety was the inclusion of a
    perspex, ' wrap-around ' guard for the belt drive which
    otherwise is running just inches from the users face in
    course of work. This machine has been replaced in recent
    years by a 'cheap and cheerful' drill press of doubtful
    ancestry, and recently a small universal milling machine was
    purchased to suplement the armoury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A throwback from the
    days of wooden models is a a small bandsaw. this is
    invaluable for producing templates and for cutting the odd
    bit of packing timber. It can be used for light metal cutting
    which is of course also carried out using a hacksaw and brute
    force. A 'nibbler' has proved useful in cutting thin sheet
    for cleading and similar purposes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THE WORKSHOP BUILDING</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Given the opportunity
    to have a dedicated building for the workshop there are so
    many possibilities that a description would fill another
    volume. We have been fortunate enough to be able to build an
    extension to the house, brick built, properly heated,
    insulated and lighted, with power and water available.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The workshop which was
    described in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 163 No.3853 really is a '
    quart in a pint pot as the Editor described it at that time
    '. The best advice stemming from experience must be that one
    should think of a size, and double it! As with all building
    work, the finished result always seems smaller than the
    drawings indicated, and anyway extra space can always be put
    to good use until filled with that new machine or additional
    storage shelves.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A well insulated
    timber building can be used as a workshop, as can the space
    at the back of the garage, and most of us know model
    engineers who produce excellent work in such places. A
    covered access from the house is desirable as in the depths
    of winter it takes some strength of character to leave the
    warmth of the house and brave the elements to get to the
    workshop! In the case of the timber building it is essential
    to insulate the walls AND THE ROOF. The latter often being
    overlooked can be responsible for massive heat loss and
    consequent condensation. The walls should be lined with
    something smooth to permit ease of cleansing and ideally the
    floor should have heavy lino or tiles to permit sweeping,
    thus simplifying the location of those small parts which
    insist on gravitating to the floor, ( and under the nearest
    machine or bench ! ) Double glazing, or at the least,
    secondary glazing of any structure is a further weapon in the
    fight against condensation as well as retaining such heat as
    can be introduced by some ' dry ' form of heating. A
    centrally heated workplace is of course a luxury. Low wattage
    tubular heaters have a lot to offer in the smaller or the
    isolated workshop. A time switch can be a benefit as the
    heating cycle can then be optimised to suit workshop ' hours
    ' whilst maintaining the gentle heat required to preserve
    tools and equipment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SERVICES</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Plenty of power points
    at bench height are a must. Provided that substantial cable
    is used these can be supplemented by extension leads with
    multiple outlets ( switched and fused ). We have a preference
    for general fluorescent lighting, local intensity of light
    being provided by anglepoise or similar fittings. Whilst low
    voltage lighting is ideal, normal mains voltage equipment has
    been used for many years without problem or accident, of
    course these lamps whether free standing, wall mounted or
    mobile are properly earthed and never mounted on the
    machines. The use of a circuit breaker is essential where
    portable power tools are used. On the topic of electricity,
    one of the most useful pieces of equipment that I possess is
    a rather ancient meter, this measures current, resistance and
    other detail to complicated for my ' ken ' but proves
    invaluable in checking lamps, earthing of equipment and the
    like</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Access to a sink,
    adjacent to the workshop yet not in it, is a great asset,
    providing for the cooling of metal, scrubbing down prior to
    soldering and so on. A sink which has become too disreputable
    for normal domestic use is ideal, and an old sink is usually
    accompanied by some old taps, so that the installation can be
    carried out by the model engineer with access to appropriate
    pipes economically and in no time at all !</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">VENTILATION </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Many hours are spent
    in the workshop environment and thought must be given to good
    ventilation. As some of the operations, such as those of
    machining cast iron and gunmetal generate a very fine dust we
    must look after our lungs. A good quality mask will do much
    to save the respiratory system from attack but the quality of
    the mask and the suitability of the cartridge to the work in
    hand is all-important.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The writers workshop
    is ventilated using a very large, Vent-axia fan bought in a
    car-boot sale, this is mounted in a box INSIDE one of the the
    fanlights in such a way that the fanlight can be opened and
    closed in the normal fashion for general ventilation
    purposes. When a forced draught is required the fanlight is
    set wide, the fan switched on, and a hinged perspex inner
    pane is buttoned down to blank-off the fanlight opening
    beside the fan housing. The fan now produces anything between
    a mild breeze and a howling gale. Air circulation is also
    assisted by two smaller fans, as used in cooling computers,
    set over the lathe and the milling machine. These fans which
    are attached by clamps can be moved easily, and as they are
    brushless can also be used to flush away the fumes from any
    small painting operations carried out in the shop.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THE LOGBOOK</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As a keen diarist some
    entry is made in the diary each day. At the same time the
    hours spent in the workshop are noted, also the activities.
    This odd quarter-hour or so, each evening is spent noting
    down details of the way in which things have been assembled,
    screw and fixing sizes and other details that will prove
    useful, both when the time comes to take the model down and
    re-assemble it, and when remaking parts. The information
    should also prove useful to anyone who may own the models in
    the future. As well as details of finished work, part of the
    entries will be sketches of the next component to be
    fabricated together with a planned sequence of machining
    operations ( Often in the ' heat of the moment t' in the
    workshop the sequence may be changed but brief notes ensure
    an awareness of critical dimensions and intended secondary
    set-ups ) It is also helpful to note down any items which
    need to be checked when next visiting the prototype.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It is said that sketch
    is worth a thousand words, many times now notes have
    disclosed a detail that had slipped the memory......... after
    all some models take many years to build and a lot of detail
    becomes buried as work proceeds. As an example, recently, due
    to some corrosion around the regulator gland it was decided
    that the mild steel studs and nuts be replaced by new ones
    from stainless steel. A few moments spent with the logbook
    confirmed that 5BA studs and nuts had been used, and not 1 /
    8 inch M.E. as they appeared on first inspection. So, as the
    result of a few jottings some years ago, as well as valuable
    time being saved the likelihood of a damaged regulator body
    was avoided. Other notes made include references to articles
    in MODEL ENGINEER and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE for future use
    when a particular operation is to be tackled. Some notes are
    reminders, which form a shopping list and ensure that a
    component cant be produced for lack of the raw material or a
    particular tool, say a drill, tap or other such item easily
    forgotten when at the shop. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On completion of a
    model, with reference to the logbook, it is worthwhile to
    prepare a set of cards, 150 x 100 index cards are ideal for
    the purpose. These shew the sequence of erection, fixing and
    fastening sizes and other detail that a future owner may find
    useful in running and maintaining the model. These form
    something like a simplified workshop manual such as one may
    have for a motorcar. A computer<br>
    ' buff ' could set up a useful database in which to record a
    number of the details mentioned, although this may not prove
    so accessible to others at a later date.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Materials. Sources of
    supply. Organised storage and the scrap box. Modifying
    available materials. An introduction to simple pattern
    making.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SOURCES OF SUPPLY</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Sourcing of material
    is an important aspect of model making. The writer makes no
    secret of the fact that a large part of the materials used in
    modelmaking is scavenged from scrap bins and 'Biffa' skips
    (with permission from the owner of course). We have also
    benefitted from the miscellaneous selections of ironmongery
    to be found at road junctions and similar spots where
    vehicles, waiting for traffic lights to change, shake
    themselves to pieces. Judging from the range of screws, bolts
    and miscellaneous metal sections one finds, much of our
    countries' transport fleet must be in imminent danger of
    collapse!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Much of the benchwork
    and shelving in the workshop, as well as the lighting
    fixtures and associated wiring have come from skips.
    Proprietors of the local engineering works are very helpful
    in this respect, to the extent that, knowing our interests
    they set aside any particularly useful items of scrap! Once
    they become aware of ones interest, friends often turn up
    with interesting bits of metal which can yield useful raw
    materials. There will be however a number of materials which
    have to be purchased and much of these will come from the
    suppliers who advertise in the model press. A good source of
    materials is the advertiser who puts up packs of useful sizes
    of bar and rod. A selection of these bundles forms a good
    basis for a modelmakers stock. Of course not all the
    materials will have an immediate application in the sizes
    purchased but a hacksaw and some elbow grease work wonders!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">ORGANISED STORAGE</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It is important to be
    able to access ones stock quickly and simply. Care in
    segregating materials and storing them in such a fashion that
    they are not damaged in store is just one further facet of
    the model engineering hobby. It makes sense to run ones stock
    in much the way it would be organised in a commercial
    workshop, noting when stocks are getting low and thus not
    finding oneself in a situation where materials have to be
    used wastefully to obtain the particular section required.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Containers suitable
    for storing small parts and materials are available in a
    variety of materials, largely steel and plastic. Often
    job-lots of containers can be purchased at auction. File
    trays are excellent for the storage of short ends of bar,
    oddments that prove so useful, provided one can lay hands on
    the when the need arises. Different materials can be
    segregated in such trays, mild steel in one, nonferrous in
    another and so on. A simple wooden or welded steel frame
    allows such a number of trays to be stacked and reduce the
    uptake of space. For smaller items plastic icecream
    containers are useful, honey jars are excellent for small
    bolts, screws etc. rotate the jar and give it a shake and the
    bolt screw that you seek will pop into view! </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Some simple methods
    for storing material:-</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Medium length pieces
    of bar, rod and tube can be stored vertically in racks
    comprising two grillages of steel bar fixed to a wall of the
    workshop, one to locate the bottom of the stock and the other
    to support the material 3 foot or so above floor level.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Short pieces of these
    materials can be stored in lengths of plastic drainpipe. The
    pipes can be cemented together and banks of such pipes allow
    both easy access and a quick check on stockholdings. Similar
    banks constructed from wastepipe and conduit will control
    stocks of small diameter tubing.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Multiple-draw storage
    units are available from DIY stores or can easily be
    manufactured in the workshop. Being wall-mounted they save
    space. Drawers marked with their contents will save hours of
    searching.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Drills are best stored
    in racks, simply made from wood blocks, it will save time too
    if tapping and clearance sized drills are stored together
    with the screwing tackle. Draws marked 'Small number drills',
    'Small cutting tools', 'Centre bitts', 'Unions', 'springs',
    'Washers' and so on, used methodically also save time and
    avoid frayed tempers. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Jars and ice cream
    containers are useful for storing small offcuts, nuts bolts
    and similar items, labeling saves precious minutes of time
    which will otherwise be expended in searching for an elusive
    piece!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When seeking space in
    which to store tools and materials remember to consider the
    space over, as well as, under that crowded benchwork. With a
    brick-built workshop and in some cases in timber framed
    buildings quite substantial loads can be supported in
    custom-built shelf frames, suspended from the roof members or
    fixed back to the walls. The shelf frames should be supported
    in such a way that the majority of the loading is applied to
    the wall fixings in shear, vertically downwards at the face
    of the wall. Shelf units placed strategically above the
    benchwork, leaving adequate working space also permit the
    installation of lighting units below the shelving providing a
    good working environment below.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Some of the materials
    used in the model engineering hobby are quite aggressive,
    some such as acids and certain paints require special
    storage. These are best kept in a metal cabinet, locked if
    there are 'little people' about the house. This is another
    instance where the same care should be taken over storage as
    is taken in industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THE SCRAP BOX</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The first port of call
    when seeking materials for a part of the locomotive will be
    the scrap box, or that odd corner of the garage or shed where
    those bits of metal ' that may come in useful one day ' are
    stored. That day is bound to come, and provided we weren't
    too ruthless the last time we sorted through in the pursuit
    of space, we will find at least a few pieces that can be
    pressed into service in our project. The materials may not be
    exactly what we need and it needs imagination to see how we
    can use some of the stuff. It may be that, rather than
    providing material for the locomotive proper, some pieces
    will provide the basis for jigs or templates to assist in the
    construction or erection work. Scrap angle steel such as that
    from an old bedstead whilst being virtually ' Monkey metal '
    could prove to be useful in the manufacture of an erection
    frame. Dexion angle can be used in mocking-up a driving
    trolley, scraps of plate may be used as the backplate for the
    jig on which the horn casting will be machined and so on.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A well-organised scrap
    box is an important asset. Some time spent in dismantling a
    defunct television set, a radio, damaged video tape case or
    virtually any piece of domestic equipment can yield supplies
    of a range of materials from self-tapping screws to sheet
    metal bracketry. Admittedly the current trend in commercial
    manufacture towards ' throw away ' engineering practice
    leaves less of a recoverable nature, but there is always some
    small thing worth keeping.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">MODIFYING AVAILABLE
    MATERIALS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Often material of the
    section or length required for the current component may not
    be available. With some adjustment either by way of a change
    of material or method something from stock may be brought
    into service. Re-cycling, sawing down angle, splitting tube,
    using chucking pieces saved from castings as bushes and
    similar dodges can save money and time. Even pieces that were
    spoiled in some previous operation, and probably thrown into
    the scrap box in disgust can prove useful when cleaned-up,
    cut-up and re-machined. Whilst apparently a wasteful process,
    producing studs by cutting the threaded portion from a bolt
    can be productive in that one finishes up with a stud, and an
    embryo bolt albeit one of much reduced length! Conversely,
    the small threaded offcut that is saved after a bolt has been
    reduced in length may well be pressed into service as a
    grub-screw in another application. Keep a few containers
    marked ' Small brass ', ' Small steel ' and so on, and you
    may be surprised how often you find just the piece of
    material that suits the current requirement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It is occasionally
    possible to find alternative uses for items which would
    otherwise be considered as domestic or garden hardware.
    instances of this are small sized hinges which can be reduced
    for use in a model, studding sold at the ironmongers, again
    for domestic use which can be brought into service as tie
    bolts for securing material for machining in the lathe or
    milling machine. Stores retailing automotive parts sell metal
    and rubber tube in various sizes and gauges also shim brass
    and steel and a number of fixings which can be put to use in
    models. DIY stores stock a number of standard sections of
    brass, aluminium and plastic which may meet a modelling need
    at some time. Even the local supermarket will stock polishes,
    scourers and abrasive materials which can be used in metal
    finishing. A number of the shops market spun or pressed metal
    products such as trays, bowl and eggcups, some in stainless
    steel others in brass. The materials and sometimes the
    geometric shape of these present possibilities to the model
    engineer, an example that springs to mind is that of the
    steam dome cover cut from the bottom of a spun brass vase!.
    The search for alternative and economic sources of material
    can be quite fun and may, to some extent, relieve the boredom
    of a domestic shopping outing.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SIMPLE PATTERN MAKING</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There have been many
    excellent articles, indeed a number of series of articles in
    the model press on the topic of pattern making. The topic is
    interesting and one which, given time, could become
    all-engrossing. Ones time available for model engineering
    activities is often limited. With such limits there might be
    some reluctance to spend the time and energy required for the
    manufacture of the more intricate pattern work required by a
    project. In this case two courses present themselves. The
    necessary casting may be obtained, as in the case of the
    horns for Pixie, by modifying some nearly similar, available
    casting. Alternatively one may turn-to and make simple
    patterns which, whilst probably beneath the contempt of the
    dedicated pattern making modeller, yield castings which can,
    by careful machining, permit the production of the required
    part.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Simple patterns may be
    carved from wood or, in the case of circular work, ' horsed '
    from plaster. Simple wooden patterns need no further
    description, as long as the resulting castings include the
    principal detail and enclose the outline of the required
    part, once the casting has been produced only straight
    forward machining operations will be required to produce the
    required component. Of course the amount of machining has to
    be limited to work that can be carried out with the equipment
    available in the workshop. Firms producing castings have
    readily accepted and cast from my simple patterns.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Plaster patterns can
    be simply produced for the most complicated parts and will
    provide the one or two uses required for most model casting
    needs. Regarding the ' horsing ' of plaster to p[roduce
    circular work such as wheels, this is an age-old skill yet
    one which has often been overlooked. The technique which was
    used for the smokebox rings for Pixie involves the
    preparation of a sheet metal template of the required section
    ( plasterers use galvanised material, but for our short-lived
    requirements any sheet will do ) The template is furnished
    with a pin which can be inserted into a piece of plate, large
    enough to accommodate the required pattern. the plate is very
    lightly oiled and the oil wiped away to leave just a
    suspicion of greasiness and the plaster laid approximately to
    the required shape. Judicious ' horsing '( scraping ) with
    the template around the pin generates a plaster master which
    when hard and coated with two or three coats of shellac or
    paint can be used to produce several castings. In each case
    the necessary allowances must be made for shrinkage, and it
    has to be remembered the finished casting will reflect
    faithfully the standard of finish imparted to the pattern. </font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">GETTING STARTED</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With a portfolio of
    dimensioned sketches and a considerable number of photographs
    under the belt it is time to make a start on planning the
    model. This is the time to do some taking-off of materials,
    not only establishing immediate needs but listing and
    probably budgeting for, the future. Ours is fortunately a
    long term hobby, and there are many facets to each project.
    Once the main equipment has been bought or made or at least a
    way of accessing equipment has been established, perhaps via
    a local evening class or community centre, the materials for
    a model can be bought in step with progress in making the
    model. This is a major economic ' plus ', bearing in mind the
    cost of materials, particularly the more exotic ones, such as
    stainless steel and phosphor bronze for which there are few
    serviceable replacements.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It is decision time
    once again! Looking through our sketches and visualising the
    model it becomes necessary to determine whether standard
    castings that approximate to those required for the model are
    to be used or modified, or whether parts will be fabricated
    from raw materials. The alternative, and this may be time
    consuming, is to have castings made from patterns which will
    be time consuming to produce. Fortunately much of this
    deliberation can be carried out away from the workshop, in
    the lounge whilst others watch the television, or during
    boring business meetings, there is no end to the scope! In
    practice, a lot of thinking can be done in the workshop or
    garage where the materials can be handled and their
    possibilities pondered. Pixie's chimney was turned from
    reinforcing steel from a building site, the platework once
    comprised the instrument panel on a piece of control
    equipment, the chassis for the driving trolley was in a
    previous existence part of a steel door, and so on. In many
    instances a considerable amount of work was required to
    rework the material and prepare it for the operations that
    would transform it into a part of the model. Often a whole
    evening's modelling time was spent in sawing or shaping '
    rough stuff ' to a stage where marking out and the work of
    machining proper could be commenced. It adds to the pleasure
    obtained from the hobby to be economic with materials and be
    prepared to do some re-cycling!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PENCIL AND PAPER</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The scrap pad or the
    notebook is a vital tool in model engineering. Time spent,
    pencil in hand will yield immense savings in the time
    required to produce parts for a model. No matter what our
    artistic abilities, as long as WE can understand our notes
    and sketches that is all that really matters! Sketches of the
    parts required for the model, ideally full size, worked-up
    from our details and dimensions, will give us a feeling for
    their eventual shape, size and ' heft '. With a sensible
    sketch in hand a start can be made on figuring out the
    material requirements, and visualising key operations in
    producing the part. Some of the operations will be those
    standard operations described so often, and so capably, by
    the expert writers in the model journals. These replicate to
    a large degree the actual methods used in the construction of
    the prototype. In many instances however because of the
    implications of available equipment or available material we
    have to be our own method engineer and consultant combined,
    and devise original techniques. The methods so arrived at may
    not of course be completely original, modellers have a saying
    that there is a precedent for everything. Whatever we
    re-invent however will give us immense satisfaction when
    successfully put into practice.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WORKING DETAILS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whether, or not, to
    produce scale drawings will depend upon individual
    preference, The writer works from sketches prepared from the
    site sketches, often after making several different sketch
    views of the item as described elsewhere. For detail which is
    critical mechanically, such as valve gear and motion work,
    measured drawings are made at the drawing board ( Well
    actually the pastry board! ), often twice full size. These
    can be used in conjunction with cut-card components to
    establish valve events, critical clearances etc.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The amount of drawings
    prepared will depend upon one's skill with pencil and paper,
    and indeed on one's particular interests. We all tackle jobs
    differently. In the case of ' Pixie ' many sketches were
    made, from all viewpoints. After some time spent in this way
    the part can probably be drawn from memory . This is very
    helpful when it comes to the time to decide upon the
    materials and methods to be employed, also in the course of
    work in the workshop. Some modellers are happier cutting
    metal but even they will have to sort out the overall sizes
    and details to enable the selection of an appropriate piece
    of stock. Working from the dimensions obtained during the
    survey each part may be sketched, as near to model size as
    possible. Some modellers may prefer to use one of the lap-top
    drawing boards complete with miniature drafting machine,
    others may even use a computer with a CAD programme. The
    writer prefers to work in sketch form on a pad of A4 paper,
    this can be done virtually anywhere, even in the bath! </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It is worthwhile
    making a series of sketches of the part in the various stages
    of production. In this way the sequence of operations in
    producing the part can be visualised and suitable chucking or
    fixing points provided. Choice of a poor sequence of
    operations can make completion of machining difficult or even
    result in the production of a substandard finish. Ideally,
    once a part is set into a chuck or mounted in a fixture it
    should only be removed once operations critical to
    concentricity or line are completed. Re-chucking a part
    causes problems, especially for newcomers in their early days
    in the hobby. Turned mandrels are often the solution to the
    problem and the need for these, and suitable jigs to hold
    small parts for finishing operations, will become apparent on
    paper as each stage of production is examined in detail.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As an aside, a fixture
    which the model engineer may like to use as a design exercise
    is a means of supporting 3 jaw or 4 jaw chucks, and
    faceplates OFF the lathe. As well as allowing set-ups to be
    established in comfort on the workbench, such a fitting is
    useful in holding material whilst setting out and during
    milling operations. The lathe manufacturer generally offers
    as an accessory a threaded mandrel replicating the headstock
    thread and it is a simple matter to attach this to a
    backplate drilled to match the slots on the top table of the
    lathe, the milling machine, drilling machine etc. Make a few
    sketches, dig out the necessary plate from the scrap box,
    buy, or better still, fabricate a replica of the spindle
    nose. A suitably threaded nosepiece can cut from a spare
    intended for use in the tailstock, leaving a useful No 2
    Morse taper mandrel which can subsequently be drilled and
    tapped for use as a backstop when machining thin discs in the
    3 or 4 jaw chuck. The result, provided care is taken to
    ensure accuracy of the fixture, as well as providing an
    exercise in sketching, simple method engineering and some
    turning and fabrication work, is a most useful piece of
    workshop equipment. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SCALING DIMENSIONS - '
    SCALEDNESS </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There will be
    occasions where small adjustments or a compromise has to be
    made between dimensions established from survey and those to
    which the model parts are eventually prepared. These
    adjustments may be required to simplify something which
    otherwise would be over complicated to manufacture with the
    means at one's disposal, to overcome erection difficulties or
    to ensure that model parts are sufficiently robust to be
    durable in service. Where a scale 4&quot; axle may be
    required the writer has no qualms about using the nearest
    available stock size, in this case, to 2 1/2 inch to the foot
    scale, 0.875 diameter. This is not laziness, or a reluctance
    to spend time on a machining operation, rather it constitutes
    the approach taken in value engineering. Time saved by
    eliminating the machining operation may well be put to better
    advantage preparing some other more critical part. Whilst
    this approach may not suit the purist, it is one that most
    people will find they can live with !</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Instances of
    compromise made in the course of constructing the model of
    PIXIE were increased thickness of the plates used for frames
    and some thinning of parts of the motion. There were one or
    two other situations such as the axles where, as noted above,
    stock bar was used rather than material turned to scale
    diameter. The amount of adjustments made by the individual
    will be determined by personal preference and standards. At
    one stage consideration was given to the unprototypical move
    of splitting the smokebox horizontally, making the top half
    removable in order to facilitate access for installing the
    blast pipe, wet header and so on. Even in 2 1/2 &quot; to the
    foot scale it is difficult to get fingers and especially
    spanners to the fittings for the blower and such items within
    the smokebox. Some thought was given to Martin Evans comments
    in ' Manual of Model Steam Locomotive Construction ' where he
    recommends split smokeboxes, in that instance for 1&quot;
    scale locomotives. Eventually the decision was taken to use a
    piece of large diameter steel steam pipe, turned to size, and
    in the event after much fiddling and bruised knuckles the
    exhaust pipes were ' persuaded ' into place. The decision has
    been regretted since however, as the substantial exhaust
    pipes and blower ring make it difficult to sweep the boiler
    tubes. A rebuild would include a split smokebox !</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FABRICATION Vs.
    CASTINGS</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As our working
    sketches develop we will be better placed to visualise the
    finished part in model form. as our prototype is a narrow
    gauge locomotive if we are working in 2 1/2&quot; to the foot
    scale we are drawing components which are, linearly speaking,
    approximately 1 / 6th full size. The finished model parts
    will be quite substantial and correspondingly weighty. It may
    well be that if we are constructing a model of an unusual
    prototype, and one for which there are few commercially
    available part, we may choose to fabricate components rather
    than make patterns for our local foundry. The coupling blocks
    and weighshaft brackets for Pixie were unusual to a degree
    and it being unlikely that more than two uses would be
    obtained from patterns, these items were fabricated. Such
    castings as were bought-in were cast from simplified patterns
    or, in the case of the horns, were modifications of castings
    produced commercially for other prototypes. Fabrication
    allows for economic use of material and in some instances
    economical use of available time. Pattern making is a time
    consuming, although enjoyable pastime, offering as it does a
    change from metal working practice and it does provide
    another most interesting avenue or aspect of manufacturing
    technology to be explored. Where club membership provides
    contact with other enthusiasts it may well prove worthwhile
    spending time making conventional patterns when the use can
    be shared with fellow members. Equally if a batch of
    locomotives were in course of construction then patterns
    providing multiple casts would be favourite.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">MODELS, MOCK-UPS ( and
    test pieces )</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The mock-up is an
    essential stage in automotive, aircraft and many types of
    full size engineering.Due to small discrepancies in scaling
    of parts, or the accuracy of our production, it becomes
    increasingly essential in our model making, . As production
    of our model parts proceeds models ' mock-ups ' help us to
    ensure proper fits in the final erection stage. For ' Pixie '
    a card model was made and superimposed on the general
    assembly sketch of the frames and cylinder casting to
    determine acceptable events in the valve settings. A model of
    the boiler fabricated from stout card was used to ensure that
    the boiler, as detailed, could be fitted between the frames.
    A further model of the saddle tank proved the position of the
    mounting brackets on the boiler, and so on. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On a larger scale, a
    dexion angle mock-up was made of the driving trolley to
    ensure a comfortable seating position with access to the
    controls, this was subsequently translated into the trolley
    described in Ch xx and has proved to be safe, stable and
    comfortable in service.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Model assemblies are
    especially important if, as in the case of the model of
    PIXIE, parts are being made from a series of sketches rather
    than a full set of finished drawings. There are however a
    number of instances such as those quoted where details can be
    proved ' in the round ' in mock up form, a task which would
    account for no little amount of head scratching in the two
    dimensions of a drawing. Apart from the technical reasons
    calling for the use of mock-ups there is a great deal of
    satisfaction to be obtained from the preview of the finished
    article presented by even the simplest model!</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Where some new
    material or technique is to be employed, time spent on a test
    piece or pieces is time well spent. instances where tests
    were performed in the production of Pixie were the trial
    flanging of the mild steel used for the sandboxes and the
    saddle tank, particularly the formation of the joggle
    sketched where the tank plates overlap. Trial rivet
    formation, used in producing the rivets for the main frame
    angles, a trial pressing of brass sheet between wooden
    formers indicated that the technique could be used in making
    the steam and exhaust pipe covers which have to fit snugly to
    the steam chests and smokebox. Unusually, in the case of
    these covers the second trial piece was found to be of
    sufficiently good standard to be used in the finished model
    !.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">JIGS AND TEMPLATES</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Jigs will be required
    to locate parts for some of the operations such as milling
    and silver soldering. Time spent in producing a simple jig
    will be repaid by the ease and speed with which the most
    difficult operations can be carried out. Jigs, used to locate
    parts in their correct position, do away with the chancy
    set-ups which are sometimes attempted, using odd bits of
    metal or wire to hold pieces for soldering, or the sometimes
    makeshift clamping arrangements to hold metal during
    machining. A simple jig permits work to be carried out
    accurately with the correct application of cutting force or
    allows brazing to be done whilst avoiding the odd movements
    whilst the metal is being brought up to heat for jointing.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An example of a simple
    jig is that used whilst soldering the components of the
    exhaust pipes for Pixie.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A piece of stock mild
    steel from the scrap box was marked out to replicate the
    position of the bolts fixing the exhaust pipe flanges to the
    cylinder casting. The key points of the set out were
    transferred using calipers and scribing lines on marking
    blue. A further piece of mild steel was welded centrally to
    provide a mounting for a bracket which in its turn secured a
    piece of studding to locate the junction piece where the two
    pipes join. The exhaust pipes passed through the flanges and
    were cut to the correct profile to seat onto the junction
    block. The whole of the jig was oxydised to prevent the
    flanges becoming soldered solid with their supports ! The
    flange bolts and those securing the two parts of the junction
    block were also oxidised. The exhaust parts were thoroughly
    cleaned and flux was applied before being assembled into the
    jig. The assembly was made using the preprepared bolts. The
    joints were then made with one heating, sure in the knowledge
    that the flanges of the finished components would match the
    fixing holes and the assembly would seat properly without
    strain.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst discussing
    jigs, ties and packing are worthy of mention. For accuracy,
    jigs must be securely fixed to the bed of a machine. This
    will be facilitated if suitable tie bolts and packings are
    handy. It is well worthwhile assembling an assortment of
    lengths of studding to match tee-nuts suited to the tee slots
    in the lathe saddle and vertical slide as well as the bed of
    the milling machine and rotary table if available. Time will
    then be saved when securing work for operations such as
    boring and fly-cutting. Studding for the purpose can be
    purchased relatively cheaply from the trade, tee-slot
    material can be bought by the length for machining in the
    home workshop. Short offcuts of bar should be marked with
    their size for quick recognition and set aside for use as
    packings. Marking using a punch on the end of the stock will
    avoid problems caused by the local ' upset ' arising from the
    punching operation. Often trade suppliers sell such offcuts
    by the kilo containing a range of useful sizes which are
    ideal for use as packing pieces. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Templates were
    produced for the machining operations on the horn castings,
    the drilling of items such as the steam chest covers, the
    drillings in the steam dome bush, the foundation ring and the
    cylinder covers. LBSC's advice was followed in the course of
    the platework and plumbing. A stiff wire was bent around
    flanged plates to give the width of plate required.
    Similarly, wire was also used to establish the route of the
    pipework and when re-straightened gave the lengths of pipe
    required. Templates were made for any offhand turning such as
    that for the cylinder covers, dome, chimney base and so on,
    ensuring that the required geometry was attained. time spent
    in thinking through jigging operations and the provision of
    templates will be amply repaid in ease of operation and the
    avoidance of scrap.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">MAKING A START </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">So now the time has
    come, to make a start on machining parts for the locomotive
    we have so carefully chosen and, on visits to site, measured,
    photographed and generally fussed over! In the workshop it
    will be necessary to make constant referance to the database,
    A plastic folder will hold and preserve the measured sketches
    from survey and our sketches pertaining to the parts to be
    tackled. A sheet of perspex in front of a striplight can be
    used for viewing transparencies which are clipped in place
    using butterfly clips. It also makes sense to provide some
    means of retaining photographs of the relevant pieces so that
    they can be viewed without being handled with ' workshop
    hands '. A piece of ply with some criss-cross tapes as used
    to hold letters in an hotel foyer will enable the photos
    currently in use to be displayed on the workshop wall. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst your
    subcontractor is casting the wheels from your patterns it is
    a good thing to make a start on the frames. Handling the raw
    steel for a 5 inch gauge locomotive gives a good impression
    of the eventual size and ' heft' of the finished frames. Our
    supplier came up with a length of ' Black steel '. This has
    an extremely tough surface and is quite difficult to work.
    Luckily, in this case , a friend undertook to surface-grind
    the material and it came back shining bright with the hard
    crust removed. It can prove helpful to carry a small file
    with you when you visit your supplier, if you are in any
    doubt about the workability of materials, a few strokes of
    the file ( on the metal! ) will tell a great deal. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Regarding thickness of
    frame material, whilst this may be accurately scaled from the
    prototype it may prove advantagous to beef-up the frames
    somewhat. Those on Pixie are from material which after
    surface grinding worked up to just over 5 / 32 inch thick
    which is in line with Martin Evan's recommendations for 5
    inch gauge locomotives in his ' Manual of Model Steam
    Locomotive Construction' </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">MARKING-OUT </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The first and perhaps
    the most critical operation is that of marking-out. The tools
    for use in marking out frames are basic, a square, a clearly
    marked steel rule, a good true straight edge and a sharp
    scriber ( the latter two items can be home produced ). If a
    marking die which comes as a laquer to be applied by brush is
    used, the coating thus formed can, with care, be scribed
    lightly to make an impression without actually marking the
    steel. Remarkably the lines thus scribed can be ' felt '
    using the tip of a sharp centre punch and will guide the
    punch to points of intersection where a punchmark is needed.
    An automatic punch which can be adjusted to make various
    depths of indentation and accommodate differing surface
    hardnesses is a useful tool. The blue can be left on the
    metal until all necessary machining is completed then wiped
    away with a rag soaked in methylated spirit. Where heat is
    generated whilst the blue is on metal the marks may require
    some stronger treatment such as a rub with emery cloth or
    wire wool. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Marking-out is best
    carried out using running dimensions, as used in the survey,
    to mark stations along the frames. Running dimensions are
    taken from one datum in each case and avoid build-up of
    dimensional errors and consequent innaccuracy likely to be
    encountered where a series of discrete dimensions are used.
    The square is used ( from a true edge of the frame steel ) to
    mark perpendiculars and then dividers or a calipers to set up
    offsets from the base line. Perhaps it goes without saying
    that the initial set-out should be checked for errors, it
    would be a pity to spoil valuable metal and waste valuable
    time by errors in setting out. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Care must be taken at
    this stage to establish the centreline of the axles in their
    running position, both vertically and longitudinally, centre
    pops either side of the eventual position of the horn
    openings will provide a means of establishing the axle
    position and determining the cylinder location, inclination
    and so on when the actual centre will have been machined
    away. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">CUTTING METAL </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Frame steel usually
    requires cutting to both length and width, a hard job but one
    made easier by rotating the hacksaw blade through 90 degrees
    in the frame and mounting the frame material in the vice
    together with a stock bar to act as a guide.This substantial
    stock bar inserted into the jaws behind the frame steel acts
    as both a guide for the saw and a stiffener retaining the
    long materials Aword here about the number of teeth on the
    hacksaw blade, and the blade tension, good quality blades
    generallybear a lael indicatingthe thickness of metal they
    are designed to cut. Selection of the correct number of
    tethmakes all the difference to tthe ease, or otherwise of
    the tsk in hand. Once the blade has been brought to initial
    tension about three complete turns of the thumbscrew
    generally suffices to set the correct blade tension.
    incorrect tension can be recognised when a cut starts townder
    from the ' straight and narrow '. One last thought on
    technique, for years we will have been tutored to use the
    forefinger of the hand gripping the handle pointed forward, '
    to guide the cut ' in the case of a wood saw. This action
    courts disaster in the case of the hacksaw, as the finger is
    liable to be the first point of contact with raw mtall in the
    case of blade breakage ! Long cuts such as those required for
    the frame profiles give time to think out the next move as
    well as providing some exercise to counteract some of the
    less energetic workshop activities! With the nett length and
    width established the frames can be cut to profile. A fairly
    recent alternative to all this hard work is offered by the
    trade, in the form of laser cut frames. There is an added
    bonus in this approach as the supplier will spot most of the
    holes ready for drilling. Accounts in the model press have
    been extremely complimentary about the prompt an acurate
    service offered by the one or two lazer-cutting specialists. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The front and back
    plates follow, again sawn to shape. Where shapes such as
    those required on the front plate are required, these can be
    produced by chain drilling and subsequent sawing. The profile
    of the frame members can be tidied up by draw filing and all
    is then set for detailed marking out of holes positions for
    rivets, horns and similar details. The side frame members
    should be bolted together at this stage using countersunk
    headed bolts (countersunk to allow the material to be layed
    flat on the bench for marking out, and more importantly flat
    on the bed of the drilling and milling machines during
    subsequent operations ) </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At this stage the key
    lines of the motionwork should be established, for this
    purpose the frames may be coated in marking fluid from behind
    the front plate to the line of the back axle or some stout
    paper glued in place. The first line will be that of the axis
    of the cylinder which will be set to coincide with the centre
    of the driving axle at its running position. This line
    established, the location of the cylinder block can be set
    out and the position of the slide bar indicated. The motion
    plate fixing holes can now be spotted with the motion plate
    normal to the slide bars. The critical angle of between the
    axis of the cylinder and the top of the steam chest can be
    measured and a template prepared for use in setting up that
    casting for machining at a later stage. All this is done
    using dimensions taken during the site survey. Later the
    critical sizes of the connecting rods, the valve rods and the
    piston rods will be established. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A JIG FOR THE WHEEL
    CENTRES </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At an early stage in
    the marking operation it is well worthwhile taking time out
    to make a simple jig to the dimensions of the wheel centres.
    This jig can be used to mark the wheel centres on the frames,
    to locate the wheel bearings and to replicate these centres
    exactly when making the coupling rods. Having set out the
    wheel centres and drilled pilot holes in the jig, it should
    be hardened and set it aside for future use. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">DRILLING THE FRAMES </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With all holes marked
    out and punched they can be spotted accurately using a centre
    bitt. This is followed by drilling using a succession of
    bitts up to the required, final size. Any slight
    innaccuracies can be corrected at an intermediate stage by
    drawing wrongly placed holes by centre-punching the edge of
    the hole on the edge to which the drill bitt has to be drawn
    during one of the intermediate drilling stages. Often the
    correct procedure for drilling holes, that of using a series
    of drills up to the finished size of hole, is omitted. Where
    this procedure is followed the opportunity for correcting the
    occasional wrongly positioned hole is forfeited,also the
    finished hole, unless reamed, is likely to be oversized.. On
    frames of this size it will be advisable to add further bolts
    to hold the frames together as work proceeds. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Horn locations can be
    spotted and opened out by drilling and sawing, finishing with
    a file or by milling. With only two pairs of horns to cater
    for in the case of an 0-4-0 filing is not too arduous a
    process!. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FRAME ANGLES </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst standard mild
    steel angle was used for the frame angles they were trued up
    by milling along one outer face to render them ' die square'
    to ensure that once they had been rivetted into position, the
    joints between frame members came up square. The angles were
    rivetted to the frames taking care that the top of the angle
    steel was quite flush with the top of the frame members. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">BUFFER BEAM AND DRAG
    BEAM </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">These were cut from
    the same material as the frames, somewhat overscale but
    substantial. The positions of the holes for rivets were
    spotted through from the frame angles whilst the whole
    assembly, frames and beams were held together by instrument
    makers clamps. The actual erection / assembly process was
    carried out on the bed of the lathe to ensure absulute
    accuracy of plane. On PIXIE as distinct from many standard
    gauge locomotives, the head of all rivets on the beams are
    countersunk. This was replicated on Pixie as were the rivet
    heads described earlier. There are a number of holes in the
    beams which give witness to various modifications made during
    service, although surveyed these were ignored at this stage
    but will be incorporated later to add to the authenticity of
    the model. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FRAME STAYS </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The frame stays on
    PIXIE are castings, these are reproduced by fabrication to
    save the time which would otherwise have been spent in making
    patterns. The flanges and fillets were shaped, pinned and
    held together with wire during silver soldering. Having
    learned the technique,silver solder is generally used to join
    items where strength is required. A word here about silver
    soldering. When first starting model engineering great
    difficulty was experienced in obtaining sound, clean
    joints.Fortunately however, a friend arranged for a brief
    training session with a dear old ' Gent ' in the local
    engineering works. He emphasized the importance of degreasing
    the materials to be joined, and the need for an adequate
    source of heat as well as the conservation of this heat by
    strategically placed firebricks. &quot; Watch the flux,&quot;
    he said, &quot; When it liquifies, touch the solder to the
    metal and see it ' flash ' into the joint! &quot; Among other
    tips which he passed on in the course of the brief session
    was that of making small centre pop marks on surfaces to be
    joined. The slight raising about the pop mark ensures a
    minute space between the two parts being joined into which
    the molten solder is drawn by capilliary action. The solder
    always flows towards the hottest component in the joint, a
    point which will prove of assistance when making a difficult
    joint. For pickle, follow Ted Jolliffe's advice in MODEL
    ENGINEER and use a solution of citric acid crystals in water.
    This is generally as effective as acid pickle and far safer
    to have about the workshop and safer in disposal. The
    crystals can be obtained in any shop specialising in home
    brewing equipment. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Many narrow gauge
    locomotives have distinctive frame details, in the case of
    PIXIE it is the stiffening angles at the top of the side
    frames, attached by prominent, large diameter rivets. Having
    had difficulty in the past with forming rivets to any degree
    of consistency, and, realising that the results achieved here
    would greatly effect the final appearance of the locomotive,
    it was decided to fabricate the rivets.The formed end and
    shank of the rivets were turned from mild steel rod. The
    formed end was held in place using a conventional ' Snap '
    whilst the shank was peened into a countersink formed in the
    dummy cone head. In the case of the ' rivets used to fix
    spreaders between the frames, these were in fact bolts with
    their heads turned to rivet profile. The cone head was made
    seperately, tapped to suit the thread on the shank and the
    fixing was made by tightening head using a specially made
    socket spanner, furnished with a pin which registered with a
    hole in the cone. A miniature tommy bar assisted in the
    tightening process and prior to final assembly the threads
    were annointed with locktite ' screwfix '. Elswhere on the
    frames, such as at the angles connecting the beams with frame
    members, standard black iron rivets were used, the shanks
    being peened into countersunk holes in heads, again produced
    seperately but drilled and countersunk rather than tapped. on
    completion of the peening processs, the ends of the shanks
    were and filed flush with the face of the ' heads ' </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">HORNS </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The axles on PIXIE run
    in heavy, sprung axleboxes, riding in cast horns.
    Consultation with Peter, a mine of information, at that time
    major domo at Messrs Kennion, in Hertford, revealed that some
    gunmetal castings, which they held in stock, would provide
    suitably shaped material which with further additions by
    silver soldering and subsequent machining could be made to
    replicate those on the full size locomotive. These operations
    were carried out, prior to the aquisition of a milling
    machine, on the lathe using a simple jig to assist in work
    holding. It seems that we amateurs do not make enough use of
    jigs and fittings, so much a feature of full-size practice.
    Where we need two similar components, and especially where
    there are four or more items then construction of a simple
    jig is well worthwhile, not the least from the safety aspect.
    Record has it that, in the course of machining materials for
    an earlier locomotive, one part flew out of a makeshift
    attachment and left the workshop through a ( fortunately open
    ) window. Jigs and fittings may take time, they can
    frequently be fabricated from scrap, and set aside, can often
    be re-used, albeit with some modification, for further work
    of a similar nature. Some tasks simply cannot be done without
    jigs or fittings, for example, to attempt turning a wheelset
    to size without a suitable mandrel would result in failure.
    Many other jobs will benefit from the time and thought
    employed in producing similar simple tools. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At this stage a start
    was made on machining the horns, the worst of the rough
    texture of the casting having been removed by filing, the
    outside face of each was cleaned up by facing cuts made using
    this tool with the horn mounted in the four-jaw chuck. A
    tungsten carbide tipped tool is kept specially for such
    operations, it is a rugged tool produced for a lathe much
    more substantial than the Myford. It is set on packing blocks
    under the holder intended to retain tools in the Myford '
    boat ' nd is capable of giving castings big licks, provided
    that is that they are securely fixed! The flat face produced
    in this fashion was then used as a datum whilst bringing the
    castings to finished thickness. Centrelines were established
    and the axlebox openings milled to slightly less thaan
    drawing size, some work with a fine file squared up the
    radiussed internal corners left from the milling operation.
    It was now necessary to solder onto the bottom of each horn a
    flange piece for later attachment of the hornstay. A jig was
    made to facilitate the final machining of the horns, it
    consisted of a backplate which could be mounted on the
    vertical slide ( those with a milling machine can of course
    use a similar jig ), fitted with a pad of steel representing
    the axlebox and having a cover plate which in effect formed a
    flange retaining the horn in position. Each horn in turn was
    set onto the jig whilst the bolting face of the horn was
    machined back by the thickness of the main frame members. The
    horns were then reversed on the jig and a small diameter end
    mill used to tidy up the back faces, around the fillets. Each
    horn was filed to shape and drilled, again on the jig, for
    the bolts which secure it to the frames. These bolts must
    have the heads thinned down. Although the slight recess in
    the back of the wheels provides ample clearance with the
    axles in their running position it has to be remembered that
    the completed wheel sets have to be assembled onto the frames
    and full-sized heads would prohibit this. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">EQUALISATION </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Consideration was
    given to making working springing. It was decided however to
    use the simple suspension achieved by the use of a hard
    rubber block as adopted on ' Sweet Pea'. Dummy springs were
    milled from brass block, these were enclosed in a fabricated
    band of mild steel and the whole drilled with a clearance
    hole for the tie rods which are screwed into the axleboxes.
    In practice the rudimentary springing arrangement serves the
    purpose of keeping all four wheels in contact with the track,
    at least on my track, described later, which is portable and
    can thus be packed to a good level when being set out in the
    garden. The spring mounting brackets were machine from the
    solid, again by milling in the lathe. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">ON MILLING </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Considerable amounts
    of milling work can be carried out in the lathe. To obtain
    the best results it is worth investing in a substantial
    vertical slide, preferably one incorporating a swivel action.
    Lateral support for the vertical slide can be taken from the
    tailstock quill and for heavy work the slide can be packed up
    from the top slide. Even without a vertical slide, a lot of
    useful milling can be done on materials either secured to the
    topslide using steel packings and strong clamps or in the
    case of smaller items clamped in the lathe tool holder. A
    range of end milling cutters and slot drills will prove
    useful in forthcoming operations. Contact with a local
    engineering works may yield a supply of used cutters which
    although past their useful life in the course of rigourous
    production work can prove useful in the amateur workshop. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As a result of the '
    crick in the neck' resulting from time spent viewing the
    milling cutter at work on material held in a vice on the
    vertical slide, that the decision was made to purchase a
    milling machine! A visit to the Model Engineering Exhibition
    afforded an opportunity to compare machines, and prices.
    Fortunately for the model engineer the exhibitors often make
    special offers on equipment and tools at the exhibition , and
    many are prepared to quote a special price if approached. For
    the occasional light machining that I was contemplating, a
    imported machine appeared to fill the bill, and as the price
    reached after some discussion, and comparison with other
    suppliers, was within my budget one was duly purchased. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With care in mounting
    the work, controlled application of cutting force, the use of
    sharp tools and other simple precautions the machine has
    proved to be a good investment. I also use it in woodworking,
    for grooving, routing and so on. It is invaluable as in the
    construction of hollow masts for model yachts, and similar
    tasks.The collet chuck is essential in achieving rigidity by
    reducing the projection of the quill from within the head of
    the machine. In the absence of an autolock chuck it is
    advisable to ' key ' cutters into the collets to avoid
    draw-out of the bitt during the cutting operation. As in all
    milling operations on such light machines it is important to
    avoid step milling, or moving the material being machined in
    the direction of rotation of the cutter, with the tendency of
    the cutter to climb onto the work. Either of these actions
    whilst using a light machine are likely to result in snatch
    with the possibility of damaged tools or worse! . Purchase of
    the milling machine called for a rotary table and a kit of
    parts or completed table which has proved quite adequate for
    the task is marketted by an advertiser in MODEL ENGINEER.
    Purchase in the completed form, saved valuable time which I
    could spend in model engineering, this saving more than
    outweighed the extra cost of a fabricated table. The table
    has been a great help in many instances from the finishing of
    valve spindle forks to simple dividing. When rounding ends of
    connecting rods and similar operations it is important to
    hold the work securely, and to rotate the work against the
    rotation of the cutter, failure to observe this rule can
    result in snatch and possibly injury. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">AXLEBOXES </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The axleboxes were
    made in two stages, a phosphor bronze bar sufficiently long
    to yield four individual axleboxes was machined to a
    tee-shaped section, the main stem of the tee, being a few
    thou' wider than the horn openings. The limbs of the tee
    formed one pair of flanges. The axleboxes were parted off
    using a slitting saw on a simple mandril in the three jaw
    chuck. A further phosphor bronze plate was then prepared to
    form the second, inside flange of each box This method of
    construction whilst, on the face of things appearing
    laborious, permits a good fit to be simply achieved in the
    next operation, that of filing to an individual fit in each
    hornblock and ensuring a good slide fit between the cheeks of
    the hornblock. The wearing surface so formed was filed
    slightly convex to avoid binding when the axleboxes move as
    the rubber springing blocks become compressed as the
    locomotive rides innacuracies in the track. The second flange
    face was now fixed into position using countersunk screws.
    Each axlebox was next drilled and bored to suit the silver
    steel used for axles, oilways were cut in each bore and the
    lubrication holes conveying oill to the axle and to the
    axleboxehorn surfaces were then drilled. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WHEELS </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The wheel castings
    were in grey cast iron, and remarkably free from casting sand
    which, if not removed, can quickly take the edge off tools.
    The castings were mounted in the four jaw and the back face
    turned until the wheel thickness was .03 inch more than the
    required finished thickness of the wheel at the boss. At this
    stage the recess in the back of the wheel, noted during the
    survey, was machined. This recess provides clearance for the
    heads of the bolts retaining the horns in the frames. With
    the back turned to profile the central hole in each wheel was
    drilled, first with a centre bitt then using successively
    larger bitts to the stage where it could be reamed to final
    size. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A plate mandrel was
    now built from materials from the scrapbox, a short length of
    1 inch diameter rod and a disc of mild steel slightly smaller
    in diameter than the flange dimension of the wheels. The rod
    formed a stout chucking piece to be gripped in the three jaw
    and was set to protrude through the plate in order to provide
    a mounting pin for the reamed wheel bores. The mandril having
    been turned true its outer face was lightly relieved so that
    the wheels would bear only around the edge. Care was taken to
    avoid any fillet at the root of the pin, which would have
    prevented the wheel casting seating properly. The mounting
    pin was drilled and tapped, using only first and second taps,
    and slit so that, when a bolt was inserted and tightened to
    the extent of the thread, the wheel casting would be firmly
    located and prevented from revolving under the force of the
    cutting tool.ith some wheel patterns the existence of a
    through hole, or the space between spokes may allow the
    insertion of a stud to further prevent the wheel turning on
    the mandril. After the mandril was inserted in the three-jaw
    a reference mark was punched on the rim coincident with the
    centre of No. 1 Jaw. During the following operations a watch
    was kept on this to ensure that it had not moved. The mandril
    was not disturbed until further work on all the wheels was
    finished. The mandril has now joined the various jigs,
    collets and templates retained for future use. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Each wheel in turn was
    mounted on the mandril, face outwards, for the flange to be
    turned and the tread coned. The old chestnut that coning
    allows for differential travel of wheels on a curve has often
    been debated, whether it does or not it certainly assists in
    maintaining an 0-4-0 centred on the track and may well reduce
    the tendency of the locomotive to yaw. Here we are reminded
    of report of the Board of Trade Inspector, Captain H W Tyler
    on the Talyllin Railway of September 1866 regarding the
    'horizontal oscillation' of the one locomotive available to
    steam the line. 0-4-0 locomotives, particularly those with
    short wheelbase and substantial overhangs are likely to
    'oscillate' and any means which may help to reduce this
    tendency is welcome. Recent reports in MODEL ENGINEER
    describe the free running of coned wheels compared with those
    having parallel treads when set to ' freewheel ' down a
    curved gradient, another item of food for thought. Coning
    completed, the radius between the tread and flange was turned
    using a tool ground to the correct form, the flanges were
    rounded by filing, (using a file with a proper handle ) and
    the chamfer put onto the edge of the tread using a sharp
    tool. Prior to removing each wheel from the mandril, the
    retaining bolt was removed and a final light cut was taken
    over the boss. A line was then lightly scribed across the
    centre of the wheel and the boss for use in locating the
    crankpin holes. In order to drill these holes, accurately
    located and perpendicular to the face of the wheel, each of
    the wheels were supported on two parallel pieces of stock bar
    in the drilling machine. A hardened drilling jig with an
    accurately located guide hole was located onto a fitted steel
    pin, set into the bore of the wheel and clamped into position
    with reference to the lines scribed whilst the wheel was on
    the mandril. Each hole was then drilled in the drill press
    and subsequently reamed to suit the crankpin, the reaming
    operation being completed on the same setup. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">. AXLES </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It was convenient to
    use silver steel for the axles, as discussed earlier the
    stock size selected approximated to the scale dimension. The
    axles were sawn slightly over length then, after turning to
    nett length, centres were formed in each end for subsequent
    turning operations. PIXIE has plain axles with just two
    shoulders, one bearing against the back of the axlebox,
    locating the axle transversely, the other acting as a spacer
    bears against the back the wheel. The shoulders and bearing
    surfaces were turned and, after re-touching the tools with a
    stone, brought to a fine finish. As the wheels were to be
    fixed using retaining fluid, the axle seatings were machined
    to leave a full thou' of clearance within the reamed bore of
    the wheels. Later the joints would be further secured by pins
    pressed into holes drilled half in the wheel casting and half
    in the axle </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">CRANKPINS </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Crankpins are of
    silver steel with turned shoulders to determine the length of
    projection. Here a slight departure from prototype was made,
    the outer end was drilled and tapped to permit a separate
    retaining flange to be screwed into place. In the case of the
    model Pixie this permitted the marine type bearings to be
    made in one piece with a dummy joint face as described later.
    In service the heads are secured by a touch of retaining
    fluid on the screw as it is turned home into the crankpin.
    The crankpins are secured by pins pressed into holes drilled
    half in the wheels and half in the crankpins. This is
    particularly important in the case of the crankpins on the
    rear wheels, to maintain the truth of the return crank
    setting. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">QUARTERING </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A variety of methods
    for quartering wheels have been described in MODEL ENGINEER
    over the years and choice must be a personal thing. The
    wheels for Pixie were quartered using twin plate templates
    accurately squared-up as a pair, bolted together, and holes
    drilled and reamed at the axle centres and crankpin
    positions. Holes were drilled at each corner of the plates
    for tie bolts used to drive the wheels into position on the
    axles. These plates were used in conjunction with a turned
    stub-centre of the same diameter as the wheel bore mounted in
    the tailstock Jacobs chuck. The centre was located in the
    tailstock chuck to facilitate access to the tie nuts in the
    next operation. The crankpins were first fitted into the
    wheels, using LOCKTITE, the bond being reinforced by a pin
    fitted into a hole drilled half in the crankpin and half in
    the wheel casting. One wheel of each pair was set onto its
    axle using locktite and the joint allowed to cure. The axle
    with the one wheel ( and with axleboxes installed!) was then
    positioned within the ' jacking frame ' formed by the two
    templates and the four jacking screws. The previously turned
    centres in the axles engaged on the point of a standard lathe
    centre at the headstock whilst the tailstock centre was
    engaged into the previously machined stub centre. At this
    stage the loose wheel, whilst supported by the stub centre
    had its bore slightly engaged on the axle end. The bottom
    edge of each of the templates was packed up, on a common
    bearing plate, to ensure they remainded correctly aligned in
    the next operation, that of feeding the wheel into place on
    the axle. The exposed bearing surface of the axle where the
    wheel was to seat was annointed with LOCKTITE as far as the
    shoulder and the nuts on the tie rods were quickly tightened,
    taking a few turns on each in rotation. The wheel was thus
    transferred from the stub centre into its correct location
    against the shoulder on the axles. Accurate quartering was
    ensured as the crankpins were correctly located by the plate
    templates which were retained in position by the carefully
    levelled packings. Once the LOCKTITE had cured each wheel was
    secured onto its axle by a pin, half in the wheel and half in
    the axle. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On reflection the work
    could have been simplified by using a smaller centre slipped
    into the tailstock sleeve, this would have supported the axle
    without the need for the roduction of a stub centre. Whilst
    the first described method worked satisfactorily, it is
    typical of the model engineering hobby that improvements, or
    at least modifications of method occur in the course of an
    operation. This is one of the reasons that the journals
    devoted to model engineering are so valuable, they form the
    forum for the transfer of ideas and new improved methods and
    are akin to the commercial concerns research and development
    department!</font></p>
