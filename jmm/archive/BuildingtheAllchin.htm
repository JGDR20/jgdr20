    redolent of our childhood when we watched what seemed like '
    'Monsters ' towing trains of trailers. The drivers were
    always friendly when we chatted with them whilst taking on
    water and on occasions allowed us up onto the footplate or
    manstand. The interest and memories persist.</font></p>
