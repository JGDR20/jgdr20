    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><strong>I have had
    requests for drawings of some of my boats. Mostly they are of
    generic design, based upon details gleaned from the web. All
    perform well and are well tried in various weather
    conditions. Having said that I had to carry out major '
    Surgery ' on the larger of my Freelancer tugs as it developed
    a startling heel when put hard about ! For details see the
    page describing the boat.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><strong>The
    measurements here were taken with care. The author provides
    all dimensions freely in the best of faith. Acceptance of the
    details given rests entirely with anyone who choses to build
    this model. Beyond the provision of details the author can
    accept no responsibility.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><strong>As I work from
    sketches there are no drawings for the large Yacht. However I
    have set out at the bottom of this page the key dimensions of
    the boat from which, given a sheet of detail paper, a rule,
    compass and a thin, flexible knot-free batten, the lines and
    sections may be developed.<br>
    <br>
    All dimensions are in mm. The deepest point of the fin has
    been taken as Datum for the dimensions of the Sheer line and
    the Keel line and their eventual location relative to the
    building board.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are a few notes to assist in preparing details:-<br>
    <br>
    The details may require minor adjustment as the lines and
    sections are developed.<br>
    <br>
    Deck plan dimensions are taken from the centreline of the
    boat to the Sheer line.<br>
    <br>
    Keel-to-chine and Sheer line-to-Chine dimensions are measured
    as verticals flat on the panel i.e. they are the actual
    dimension of the inclined panels. These dimensions in
    conjunction with dimensions taken from the plot of the Sheer
    and Keel lines allow the frame details to be established.
    When cutting ply for panels an allowance should be made for
    trimming when in place on the frames.<br>
    <br>
    </strong></font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>The
    key lines drawing..........................</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><strong><br>
    On a suitably sized sheet of paper draw the horizontal line
    of the Datum, vertical lines at the Station points and, at
    the top, the line representing a Building board ( allow space
    to access for parting the sheeted hull from the board ). On
    each station line from 1 to 10 mark the Keel point and the
    Sheer point with reference to the Datum. The position of the,
    mast step, fin and rudder can also be plotted.<br>
    <br>
    (A 1200mm long, small section, knot-free batten is bent
    around these point to draw the ' smooth curves ' of the lines
    in elevation)<br>
    <br>
    On the same sheet the deck plan can be established from the
    Centreline-to-Sheer dimensions.<br>
    <br>

    face="Arial"><strong>............................</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><strong><br>
    On a separate sheet of paper or card draw the vertical
    Centreline. Then either side of the Centreline draw in the
    Datum line, Keel line and the Sheer line at the station being
    developed, also a line establishing the building board level
    which is common to all frames.<br>
    <br>
    Using a compass, arcs are struck from the Centre line at the
    Keel level and the sheer line plotted from the Deck
    dimension, in each case using the appropriate panel width, to
    establish the Chine position at their intersection.<br>
    <br>
    The details can then be used in fabricating the frames which
    include a deck beam at sheer level.<br>
    <br>
    </strong></font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Construction</strong></font><font
    color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><strong>......................<br>
    <br>
    The frames can be constructed of ply (or stripwood with
    corner stiffeners ) The frames to be extended to a common
    height to permit attachment to the building board when turned
    through 180 degress.<br>
    <br>
    Once the basic frames are set up on the building board at
    their staions, intermediate frames can be developed as
    required using the batten. Some frames will require
    fairing-off to provide full support for the sheeting panels
    At this stage final adjustment can be made to the cutouts for
    the Sheer, Chine and Keelson to ensure that these sit
    properly. In all cases allowance has to be made for the ply
    thickness selected for the deck and panels.<br>
    <br>
    At this stage the sheeting can be test fitted. it is helpful
    in the final placement, if during the trial fit, pins are
    driven at key points and removed leaving small locating hole
    in the frames for the first few final fixings..then with the
    frames given a coat of adhesive the panel can simply be
    located in its intended location<br>
    <br>
    Later, when the hull panelling is complete suitably shaped
    additions can be added to the deck beams which are integral
    with the frames to form the deck camber to the builders
    requirements.<br>
    <br>
    The Prow and Stern before the first, and and after the last
    station can best be formed from hardwood blocks, rough-cut
    and shaped after fixing to maintain the curves of the hull.
    The stern can be shaped to the builders requirements *.<br>
    <br>
    The amount of ballast required on the fin can be determined
    in a floatation test once priming and undercoat have been
    applied to the hull. Layers of lead flashing material ( later
    suitably coated ) can be applied as required. These can be
    taped in place and added or removed prior to final fixing to
    achieve an acceptable waterline.<br>

    The key dimensions of the model are given below:-<br>
    <br>
    The station points* are established at 100mm centres, Station
    Number 1 being 10 mm from the Prow of the boat.<br>
