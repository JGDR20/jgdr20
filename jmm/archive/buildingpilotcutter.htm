<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">Having built a
variety of scale and freelance radio controlled model boats and
one static model of a Silhouette ' sailer / trailer', a vessel
close to my heart. I became interested in the history of pilot
cutters:-</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">Pilot cutters of a
type which date back to the late 19th, early 20th, Century (some
of even the older ones are, still sailing ) were designed to cope
with all manner of weather and extremely rough seas. Their
purpose was to ferry harbour pilots to incoming packets to strike
contracts for pilotage through difficult channels into harbour.
Quite similar vessels plied their trade from a number of major
ports around our Island, often they raced to compete with other
pilots.Their function demanded speed and the ability to sail in
the worst of conditions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">The history of the
boats can be read on many sites on the web, and replicas of the
better known craft are still built for enthusiastic sailors. To
read about them and view images all that one needs to do is visit
Google Search ' <em>Images </em>' and type in ' <em>pilot cutters</em>
' then click on items of interest, this will take you to
appropriate websites. YouTube <em>' Pilot cutter videos '</em>
show many illustrations of cutters afloat and under construction,
a mine of information. Shots from the videos for personal use
only and for reference purpose can be downloaded by pausing the
video and using one of the many ' freebee 'capture programs. Be
careful to observe copyrights however.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="5" face="Arial">Establishing
details</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">As described above
my search began on Google. I studied the detailed images, videos
and looked at various lines drawings. All the boats were notable
for the hull design which combined speed with stability while
carrying substantial areas of sail. The hull form is best
appreciated by viewing pictures of boats under construction on
the sites of present day boat builders in the UK and abroad. As
this model will be compounded from views of original boats,
renovations and recent productions on the web also what I have
deciphered from the various lines drawings, the model should
convey a ' Picture ' of the breed of boats. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">The start was made

involves cutting layers of wood to the plan profile of the vessel
providing a series of sections from keel to deck. These are
bonded together and the final hull form is generated by carving
from the resultant roughly shaped solid block guided by the joint
lines between layers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">The glueing
technique used here was first tried by fixing a few planks to a

minimal amount of PVA on the underside of each plank, keeping
away from the edges, then pressing the wood into position as the
PVA <em>' Grabs ' </em>the freshly placed plank. There are then a
few minutes in which to adjust the position. The curve of the
sub-deck leaves a convincing scale sized joint. Any unruly planks
can be weighted down while the glue hardens. A light sanding, in
the direction of the grain, overcomes any discrepancies in level.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Arial">I was always wary
of using PVA for small work as I thought that balsa cement
provided a better immediate <em>' Grab '</em>...Lately I have
been happier with PVA which, provided the surfaces are well
prepared, ensures early location with just enough time for final
accurate location. Joiners always speak of ' <em>Rubbing in a
glue block ' </em>and this process has proved over the years to
ensure an intimate bond with a minimum glue line. </font></p>
