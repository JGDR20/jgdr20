        and things......................largely from scrap !</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Arial">Whilst
        setting up the pages ' <em>Building the Allchin</em> ' I
        mentioned that, with a lathe and, posiblly a light mill
        or substantial drill , apart from the jigs and templates
        required for a particular project there are a number of
        useful items of equipment that can be constructed, often
        from scrap.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Arial">Whilst the
        purchased product may look better, the home produced
        article can cost much less. yet meet the basic
        requirements of the task for which it is made. The
        following images show several such attachments largely
        prduced from scrap and material gleaned from skips ( by
        permission of the owners ! )</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">This 4 way indexing
        toolpost cost just the price of the capscrews and the
        plastic knob, the rest was the cost of the blood, sweat
        and tears that went into sawing the offcuts of plate and
        applying a spot of welding rod. I like the large knobs as
        they are easy on the hands in frequent use.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">The left hand
        image, a simply made attachment. permits indexing using
        the lathe bullwheel. It is attached inside the headstock
        using a tapped hole thoughtfully provided by Messrs
        Myford, the plunger engages with the bull wheel. On the
        right is a fly cutter/facing tool for use with the
        imported milling machine. Capscrews are used to fasten
        the block of barstock to the mill. Scrap steel was used
        in both cases.</font></p>

        left, the small block of metal, twice slotted, three
        times drilled, twice tapped and once bored hold a boring
        bar which accommodates short cutters from tool steel. it
        proved useful a number of times in constructing both<em>
        Pixie </em>and the <em>Allchin. </em>On the right,
        salvaged steel used to construct a rear toolpost. If
        anything revolutionises parting-off it is the rear
        toolpost, particularly for the amateur. In the event of '
        An issue ' as problems are termed today. a jamb, or a
        dig-in the tool tends to lift slightly and further damage
        can be avoided. both items were made for the cost of the
        knobs, cap screws and some more sweat !</font></p>

        necessary to build a hoist to handlethe ' Allchin ' about
        the workshop and 'Pixie ' onto the track and the bench. I
        thought of buying an engine hoist as is used in
        garagesbut as it would only be used occasionally the cost
        ruled that out. Then I decided to design and build my own
        ' Bespoke ' hoist.</font></p>

        through a few skips for suitable materials unearthed some
