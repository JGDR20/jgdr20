            nostrums</font></p>
            <p><font face="Technical">By John, with apologies to
            an anonymous Greek philosopher!</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="4" face="Technical"><strong>STANDARDS</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Establish an acceptable
        standard, and work to it. It is better to finish a
        working model than to find yourself endlessly remaking
        parts to meet your improving standards.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Do not shrink from scrapping a
        substandard part which will affect the PERFORMANCE of the
        finished model.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Try to avoid the ' last
        finishing touch ' that sometimes spoils the job !</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Technical"><strong>RESEARCH ( and
        survey for scratch building )</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Your local reference library is
        a mine of information, the librarian will help in
        locating sources. You can photocopy items of interest for
        use in the workshop. </font><font size="3"
        face="Technical">The ' Web ' is of course the ultimate
        source, good browsing and search techniqueis essential
        however.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Always have a program in mind
        for site survey visits, this will save time and ensure
        that you get the information you need</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Pre-prepare sketches where
        possible these save time and act as a reminder to ensure
        that the key dimensions are taken during your visit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Take every opportunity that
        presents itself for listening to ' real engineers '</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Beware the local ' expert ',
        helpful as he may be, often he only remembers what is
        important to him, always try to get authentication from
        an additional source. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Take photographs and make
        sketches, these supplement dimensions which have to be
        interpreted back in the workshop.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Include a measuring tape, rule
        or coin in your close-up photographs this will assist in
        determining sizes later.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Make notes to accompany your
        sketches.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Maintain a source file, include
        web addresses, press cuttings and photographs. Note down
        details of articles of interest in journals, it is often
        necessary to check on some specific technique,
        temperatures, clearances and suchlike information. It
        takes a long time to thumb through 20 years back numbers
        of MODEL ENGINEER ! </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Technical"><strong>WORKSHOP</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Technical">Ventilation and
        lighting ( particularly local to machines ) are essential
        considerations in the workshop. Many hundreds of hours
        will be spent there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Technical">Heating, even minimal
        to raise the dew point is a great asset, whatever the
        fabric of the shop.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Try always to have a clear idea
        of the sequence of operations which you intend to employ.
        Once that chucking piece has been cut away concentricity
        may be lost. Once a special set-up has been broken down
        it will be difficult to replicate </font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Remember to install important
        items such as solid axleboxes onto axles before final
        fixing of wheel sets.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Remember right and left '
        handing ' of components, it's easy to make two identical
        fittings, only to discover that one should be of the
        opposite hand to the other ! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Observe the same safety
        practices as you would in an industrial workshop, use eye
        and ear protection.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Always secure work carefully
        before milling and drilling, use vices, clamps etc. to
        avoid hand and finger damage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Swarf spinning on a drill is
        nearly invisible, take care, it can strip your flesh to
        the bone or at least cause a bad cut.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Avoid the use of scrim or rag
        adjacent to revolving materials, they are easily
        caught-up and can drag a finger, or hand, into the '
        works '</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">After cutting lengths from
        stock materials remove burrs before returning offcuts to
        stock. Ensure that your workplace is well lit, warm, and
        well ventilated. You are going to spend many hours of
        your life there if you intend to make a model locomotive
        !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Check the fixity of jigs,
        templates and the workpiece after initial cuts, and in
        the course of the work especially when intermittent cuts
        are being made.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Vary your work pattern. Changes
        improve your interest level and aid concentration, never
        force yourself to work on your model if there are
        distractions, if you are tired, out of sorts or otherwise
        not really keen to do so. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Clear up the workshop after
        each session, you'll be more inclined to want to go back
        there and can make greater progress in the next visit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Cover down the lathe bed when
        machining aggressive materials, dusts combine with oil to
        make an efficient grinding paste !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">If you visualise a problem
        ahead, put it to the back of your mind and busy yourself
        with some other aspect of the model, the subconscious
        mind is a powerful tool and works wonders, even whilst
        you \par sleep !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Try not to finish a spell of
        work on a ' downer ' , if something has gone wrong try to
        correct it before you leave the workshop, or you may
        never go back to it!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Make the best use of odd spare
        moments in the workshop. Whilst you may feel compelled to
        press on with some major part there are always tools
        which will benefit from sharpening or nuts, olives or
        other small parts to be made. Sometimes it is nice to
        just sit in the workshop and think about the next
        move,often we don't do enough of this!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Keep a notebook. Note detail
        changes, record thread sizes and sequence of erection.
        Your model may take some years to build and such detail
        is easily forgotten. Hopefully the model will be passed
        into other hands eventually and records will then prove
        invaluable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Never allow a small child to
        venture into the workshop unacompanied, they are always
        inquisitive and little hands go everywhere !</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Technical"><strong>TOOLS</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Buy the best tools that you can
        afford, and buy them now. They are bound to get more
        expensive as time goes on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">If you store tools in the same
        place between each use, you will find them quickly when
        you need them, especially important in emergency, when
        you need one in a hurry !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Keep workshop tools in the
        workshop, try to avoid having some parts of your kit in
        the car or the garage, in these cases they are rarely
        where you actually need them for the work in hand.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">If you mislay a tool within the
        workshop, start to clear up, the tool will soon emerge
        from its hiding place, under something or behind
        something else ! \</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Make a note of loans. With the
        best of intentions, friends and acquaintances often
        forget the source of a loan and tools get lost forever
        that way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Always sharpen tools after use,
        that way they will be ready for use when next needed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Technical"><strong>MATERIALS</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Store materials methodically,
        they will be easier to locate and shopping lists become
        easier to prepare when available stock is visible.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Maintain a ' shopping list ' it
        is easy to forget some stock requirement when surrounded
        by all the interesting items at your stockist's emporium
        !\</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Visit your model engineering
        materials supplier other than at peak periods. The man
        behind the counter has seen it all before. He hears
        accounts of success and failure, knows of the
        effectiveness of various techniques and can advise on
        materials applications.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">You will find that the supplier
        knows his stocks and can advise on alternatives,
        particularly such items as near -size castings which with
        some small modification can be adapted for use in your
        particular model.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Where funds allow, buy
        additional pieces of frequently used standard materials,
        the offcuts will always prove useful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Keep aggressive materials,
        acids, chemicals etc. in a locked metal cabinet. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Always mark containers to
        indicate the contents, unmarked containers are
        dangerous.\par Maintain a well ordered scrap box, view
        materials with an eye to alternative uses to which they
        \tab\tab can be applied, a scrap radio, TV set or even a
        video cassette can yield endless numbers of useful
        screws, brackets and so on. The older, timber TV cabinets
        can be transformed into storage shelving, or the material
        which will be well seasoned can provide mounts or bases
        for models.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Technical">Save those chucking pieces,
        they can provide the material for a valve gland or some
        other small part</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Technical">OK! So it all sounds like the
        'Counsel of perfection', but we do manage to achieve some
        of the recommendations !</font></p>
        <p><font size="5" face="Technical"><strong>Take care, and
        enjoy your model engineering. </strong></font></p>
