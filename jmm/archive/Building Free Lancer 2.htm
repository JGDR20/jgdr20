    new development on my model boat front ! </strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Technical">Having built and sailed
    Free Lancer all as described on another page, thoughts turned
    to the next project !</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Technical">Model boat building
    promotes various skills such as woodworking and miniature
    engineering having the added advantage that construction can
    be broken down into a series of ' Bite size ' pieces. Work
    can be fitted into spare hours and half-hours. Planning the
    project and the building process can be carried out anywhere
    so a boat it had to be.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Technical">Having had some success
    with the workboat ' Free Lancer ' I decided to build a larger
    version which would provide more space for accessories such
    as a sound module and a water pump. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">This is Freelancer 2 as I designed it.
    In tests the on the water when completed ,whilst it looked
    well and performed well, there was a problem with excessive
    heel on turns. To see how this problem was resolved go to the
    last few images on this page.</font></p>

    .................In the case of Free Lancer a considerable
    amount of lead ( From a skip ) was required along the line of
    the keel to reduce the heel on tight turns although on test
    it would recover from 20 degrees or so of heel. This boat
    will need less ballast and be more stable.</font></p>

    the outcome of the surgery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Then I sawed through then removed the
    superstructure just above the engine room level, that being a
    permanently attached to the hull.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">A few days and many hours later the
    remaining upper works were tailored to fit the fixed part of
    the superstructure and the whole thing looks as if it was
    designed that way.........................a lesson learned
    and goodbye excessive heel !</font></p>

    boatwith the wheelhouse lowered.....after all bits are
    sometimes added to boats..........so why shouldn't bits be

    <p><font face="Arial">After modification, less heel on the
