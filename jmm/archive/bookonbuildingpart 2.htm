        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">'
        PIXIE ' has round-section coupling rods terminating in
        marine bearings at each end. The coupling rods for '
        Pixie ' are made from lengths of silver steel, shouldered
        and entered into the bolting flanges at each end. These
        joints were brazed and the faces cleaned up. The bearings
        were simulated on ' Pixie 'using blocks milled from mild
        steel incorporating the profile of the prototype
        castings. Each block is scribed deeply to represent the
        joint between the two parts of the bearing and each
        crankpin hole is fitted with a pressed-in phosphor bronze
        bush. The length of the coupling rods was checked against
        the wheel centre template made earlier. Small adjustments
        were required at this stage, due no doubt to minor
        differences in dimension at each joint. Adjustment was
        achieved by turning-off the inner ends of the bearing
        blocks in the four-jaw chuck. To complete each assembly,
        matching keeper plates were filed to shape, clamped in
        place on the coupling rod ends together with the bearing
        blocks and the whole assembly was then drilled for
        bolting. mm size bolts were found to be very near to the
        required diameter and these were used, the heads being
        turned to the shape of those on ' PIXIE '. The thread
        ends were turned away and the bolts drilled for split
        pins. Oil cups are fitted to each bearing block. For '
        Pixie ' these were machined from brass hexagonal
        material, which provided the flats by which the cup is
        screwed into the block. A small form tool ground up from
        a slip of toolsteel ensured the same 'antique' profile to
        each cup. The cups are topped off by a threaded cap
        screwed into place, these were reproduced by turning down
        the heads of BA bolts and knurling the periphery of the
        resulting head. It was noted at the time of the first
        survey that any missing caps were replaced by corks, as
        yet no caps have gone missing from Pixie so this has not
        been necessary! Each of the upper bearing bolts has a
        turned groove coincident with the oil cup to allow
        lubricant to penetrate to the bearing surfaces.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        ' PIXIE ', braking arrangements are simple in the
        extreme, there being only two blocks acting on the front
        of the rear wheels. The brake hangers are pieces of bar
        drilled for fixing to the frames, for the brake block
        pivot pins and attachment to the brake rod. The brake
        blocks we r e cut from a ring of mild steel turned to
        match the wheel section internally and externally to a
        section which could be milled to provide the hanger slot.
        The hangers pivot on shouldered studs, captive in the
        frames and backed up by large square washers. The pivot
        pins securing the blocks to the hangers are fitted with
        split pins. OILBOXES \par \par Four brass 'trays' or
        reservoirs for axlebox lubricating oil are mounted on the
        stiffening angles. The reservoirs and their hinged lids
        were milled from some anony mous brass from the scrap
        box, probably parts of electical switchgear dismantled in
        the ongoing ' salvage and alternative uses campaign !
        Rubber tubing forming minute pipes conveying oil to the
        bearing surfaces of the axleboxes was obtained from a
        suppl i er of laboratory equipment, a useful source of
        speciality items such as rubber and plastic tube. The
        pipes are attached to small diameter copper pipes silver
        soldered into the oil trays. The feed to the bearings is
        via similar copper bends which are solde red into the
        axlebox castings. Old fashioned fluffy wire pipe cleaners
        pushed into these bends stems the flow of oil to ensure a
        constant flow of the necessary lubrication at the
        critical points. </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PIXIE
        has a mechanical lubricator mounted on a steel plate
        fixed using two bolts through the right hand frame angle.
        On the model this is replaced by a proprietary lubricator
        from Norman Spinks. The lubricator was seen in an
        advertisement, catching the eye because it incorporates
        roller clutches rather than a ratchet and pawl mechanism,
        this allows an infinately adjustable stroke. The oil case
        is not too unlike that on the prototype, except that it
        lacks an oil level gauge. On Pixie, as on the prototype,
        the drive is taken via. a small diameter rod clamped to
        the valve rod, adjustment to the flow being achieved in
        the model form by selecting one or other of the holes in
        the pump actuating lever. The geometry of the action can
        be adjusted by nuts set on a threaded portion of the
        actuat ing rod. When first seen PIXIE was carrying diesel
        coupling blocks, and, as this is how she was to be
        recorded, diesel coupling blocks were next on the agenda.
        The dimensions from my survey were set out in sketch form
        and the scrap box yielded the majority of the small
        pieces of mild steel required for fabrication. Access to
        TIG welding equipment provided the opportunity to
        assemble the parts ' in the square ' and a session with
        the angle grinder, used offhand, introduced the necessary
        geometry. A study of the prototype front plate revealed
        the fact that a variety of attachments had been made
        during the life of the loco but currently the blocks are
        attached by 4 large diameter bolts, these are replicated
        by BA bolts.The coupling pins were turned fom scraps of
        mild steel rod. These were cross-drilled whilst clamped
        onto a vee-block. A line was scribed on the periphery of
        the head, a centre finder was used to scribe a diameter
        coinciding with this line. The centre of the cross hole
        was marked with a punch. The pin with the diameter set
        vertical was clamped in a vee block and a pointed wiggler
        used to locate the punch mark below the centre bit in the
        drill press. An overlever clamp remains on the drill
        press table at all times providing a simple means of
        retaining material and jigs during drilling operations.
        The fact that the clamp is ' resident ' avoids situations
        where one might otherwise be tempted to ' take a chance '
        by holding something for a one-off drilling operation,
        putting ones fingers in jeopary at the time of the drill
        breaking through when snatch is liable to take place.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Two
        support brackets were fabricated from plate and angle
        steel, these are important as they support the weight of
        the bunkers. They are rivetted back to the main frames
        using dummy rivets as previously described. The rails are
        sections of angle rivetted to the main frames and the
        drawbeam at footplate level, those supporting the outer
        plates being at a lower level than for the c e ntre
        plate. The centre footplate is slotted for the damper
        handle and provided with a cranked angle which engages in
        the handle to provide several settings of the damper
        opening. There is also a checkout for the drain pipe from
        the water gauge. The rail which trims the outer
        footplates is cut and bent to form a curve matching that
        of the bunker later mounted above it. PIXIE'S footplates
        are replicated in the model by stainless steel plates
        which are bolted to the angles and rails. </font></p>

        top of each of the frame stiffening angles are mounting
        blocks on which are seated the bearing flanges on the
        boiler. On the prototype the brackets are fabricated from
        steel angle, these are reproduced in the model although
        to ensure that the boiler would sit true to level within
        the frames, final machining to height was was left until
        the boiler could be offered up into position and the
        appropriate dimension established. Cutouts were required
        in the stay immediately behind the boiler, these provide
        clearance for blowdown valves, sited just above the
        foundation ring. Details not to be found on the full-size
        locomotive are the holes for dumping rods or pins which
        allow the ashpan to be dropped in case of emergency.
        Whilst the downward movement of the ashpan is restricted,
        there is still sufficient room for the grate to drop and
        the fire to disperse in the event of the pins having to
        be pulled in case of emergency These details just about c
        omplete the frames. Of course detail varies from loco to
        loco and there is a lot of enjoyment to be obtained from
        identifying details for inclusion in ones model. It may
        be that a particular prototype has been modified at some
        time in its life, something a dded, a piece of plate
        fixed at a potential crack position or some other '
        adjustment ' made in service. For example, in the case of
        PIXIE there are some plates bolted to the front of the
        weatherboard where at some stage the angles have been cut
        and subsequently rejoined. These are yet to be
        incorporated in the model. It is well worth while
        researching such detail which will go a long way to
        improving the authentic atmosphere of the finished model.
        On PIXIE there is a small piece of plate attached to the
        front frame member, this provides a purchase for the
        bolting attachment of the drain cock return spring. Small
        details such as this which were perhaps an afterthought
        on the part of the designer, or an innovation on the part
        of a restorer, help to promote the atmosphere so beloved
        of the narrow gauge enthusiast.</font></p>

        SADDLE </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        smokebox saddle is a simple casting, produced from a
        rudimentary pattern which governed the profile with
        allowances for shrinkage but incorporating no fine
        detail. The casting was clamped to the topslide and the
        bolting faces were machined using a fly cutting tool.
        This useful tool simply produced in the home workshop
        comprises a substantial section of 2 1/2 &quot; diameter
        bar with a drilled hole for a circular tool and a grub
        screw set in the perimeter to enable the toolsteel to be
        set at the correct angle. The mass of metal comprising
        the body of the tool when CHAPTER NINE gripped in the
        three jaw chuck serves to induce a 'flywheel' action
        reducing the effect of the intermittent cutting, a
        feature of flycutting operations. in order to increase
        the versatility of the attachment it is provided with
        three further holes which match the centres of the tapped
        holes in the faceplate on the milling machine quill. This
        arrangement is always used when heavy cutting / planing
        operations are carried out in the mill. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        seating for the smokebox and the small rebate which
        conceals the joint between the saddle and the smokebox
        were fly-cut whilst the saddle was fastened to the
        vertical slide, set parallel with the axis of the lathe.
        When setting a fly cutting tool to radius it is essential
        to remember that too small a radius will result in metal
        being cut away from the depth of the concavity, i.e. with
        too great a rise on the chord. Cutting should be started
        with the tool set to a slightly larger radius than that
        finally required, the tool being adjusted inwards, slowly
        reducing the radius of the cut until the finished radius
        is achieved! This needs a little thought but a few lines
        on a piece of paper will soon verify the facts, and may
        save a valuable casting from destruction! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        completion of the machining operations the small gussets
        which stiffen the bolting flanges on PIXIE were silver
        soldered into position, leaving an generous fillet of
        solder to replicate those on the casting. At this stage a
        template was prepared for the location of the cylinder /
        frame fixing bolts The centre line of the cylinder was
        transferred to this template and the template set aside
        for later use. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">CYLINDERS
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        cylinder castings were made from simple wooden patterns
        which followed the main outline of the pieces. In view of
        the writer's limitations in the pattern making
        department, it had been decided that such items as
        seatings for the valve spindle and piston glands would be
        added after the main machining operations had been
        carried out. First the top face of the casting was fly
        cut to the correct inclination. This angle was determined
        from a trial set out in marking blue on the frame, using
        the dimensions from survey and the template previously
        prepared. As well as providing a plane surface to assist
        in setting out this face would later determine the
        correct angle for boring the cylinder. The next operation
        was that of machining the steam chest. PIXIE has the
        steam chest integral with the cylinder casting, and this
        called for some massive excavations in the model casting
        ! A new term was added to the vocabulary at this stage.
        Conversation with a ' real ' engineer evinced a
        description of an operation known as ' hogging-out ' This
        elegant term describes the process of making multiple
        drilled holes within the area which would eventually
        become the steam chest cavity in the casting, before
        finally the remaining few pieces of metal were milled
        out, using an end mill, to leave an accurate cavity. This
        procedure was duly followed and the resulting steam
        chests proved to be acceptably accurate. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Having
        cleaned up the perimeter of the steam chest, attention
        was then turned to boring the cylinders. This was carried
        out with the castings secured to the topslide using
        straps of stock material in conjunction with suitable
        packings and tie bolts to retain the casting securely
        during the fairly substantial cuts of the boring
        operation. A word of warning...... unless ties such as
        used in this instance are set absolutely vertical,
        relative to the topslide, with, in this case tapered
        packings properly anchored into position to provide a
        firm purchase, they may loosen in the course of boring,
        with dire results. The tendency is, due to the cutting
        effort applied together with vibration in the system, for
        the tie bolts to loosen as they assume a position normal
        to the topslide and the tee-nuts therein. At this stage
        the cross travel of the saddle must be locked by
        tightening the clamp nut. On my lathe I have fitted a
        short lever here to enable me to exert stronger pressure
        on the clamp bolt without the need to use a spanner. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Once
        lined with the axis of the lathe and with the correct
        inclination determined by the previously fly cut face,
        the ties checked and the cross-slide secured against
        movement, a start was made on drilling for the piston
        rod. PIXIE only has one cylinder cover on the front end
        of the cylinder, the piston-rod passing through a gland
        on the the closed end of the casting. Drilling for the
        piston rod was done using bitts held in a
        headstock-mounted drill chuck. This operation was started
        using an end mill to provide a flat land on which the
        centre bitt could bear without being deflected, after the
        centre bit a succession of changes of drill size, up to
        clearance size for the rod, ensured a correctly located
        and accurately sized hole. The hole was not reamed
        because reaming to finished size can, in this instance,
        when the gland nut is inserted, form what is in effect a
        'self locking clutch'. Any misalignment of two reamed
        holes occurring in the course of taking-up the gland
        causing the piston-rod to bind. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        cylinder bore was cut using a specially made, short,
        stiff boring tool set up in the four jaw chuck which in
        this instance was used as a boring head. On the Myford
        this required some thought. Finally reference to, would
        you believe, a page by ' Geometer ' in the 6th September
        1962 issue of MODEL ENGINEER provided the solution ! Two
        pieces of 1/4&quot; plate were cut and inserted between
        the jaws. This allowed the boring tool to be moved
        laterally across the axis of the machine, within the
        central hole in the chuck, by the amount required to
        bring the bore to finished size. The metal plates ensured
        that at all positions of the tool it was still supported
        by all four jaws. A proper boring head would have
        simplified the operation but, bearing in mind the few
        occasions on which such a tool would be used, budgetary
        considerations determined that other accessories were
        more important. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        machining bores which are to have a cylinder cover at one
        end only it is necessary to guard against producing a
        bell-mouthed bore. This is best achieved by bringing the
        bore nearly to finished size then taking only very fine
        finishing cuts. LBSC called this ' taking the spring out
        of the tool '. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Cylinder
        boring completed, the writer encountered a piece in MODEL
        ENGINEER by Keith Wilson relating to the profile of
        cylinder bores. Given the benefit of Keith's experience
        earlier in the course of building Pixie the cylinder
        bores would have been made according to his ' words and
        music '. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Next
        the position of the ports was established and the milling
        machine brought into play to cut them. These were not the
        working ports, as the port faces were to be in stainless
        as described earlier. They were cut within the outline of
        the eventual port positions to a depth which would permit
        the steam ways to intercept within the metal between the
        bottom of the steam chest and the cylinder bore. The
        steam inlet and the exhaust passages from the steam chest
        terminate on the top face of the cylinder block where the
        flanged pipes seat. These passages were drilled from the
        bolting face of the cylinder block and were, after the
        vertical parts of the passages had been drilled and swarf
        cleared from the holes, subsequently sealed by small
        turned and threaded plugs with slotted heads similar to
        grubscrews. The plugs were anointed with liquid gasket
        prior to being screwed home. The slotted heads of the
        plugs enabled insertion using a screwdriver and were of
        course concealed between the cylinder casting and the
        frame after erection. No excuses are offered for the use
        of liquid gasket. Joints do not need to be taken-up too
        tightly, the synthetic rubber hardens as it cures, excess
        is easily stripped away with a sharp knife, and a good
        seal results each time. This technique may not be in line
        with the practice adopted in the prototype but I feel
        sure that, had Engineers of yore been given access to
        liquid gasket, they would have used it. Indeed it is
        interesting to ponder, given the range of materials
        available to us today, what the Trevithics and
        Stephensons would have selected for their constructions
        were they here to make the choice ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        passages between the valve chest and the cylinder ends
        were drilled in the drill press, care being taken to
        achieve the correct inclination by packing and clamping
        to the drill table. First the open end of the cylinder
        was prepared with the bevel which allows steam to pass
        into the cylinder, this was done by filing , using a
        scrap of brass to shield the bore should the file slip.
        As well as permitting the passage of steam in service,
        this bevel allows the hole positions to be spotted with a
        fine punch to ensure that the smallest centre bitt can be
        started correctly. LBSC's tip on grinding the drill bitts
        used to drill the channels with one lip wider than the
        other to enable a broken bitt to be extracted is a
        winner, as was proved in the process ! There is nothing
        quite like the panic that one experiences when a drill or
        a tap breaks in an expensive casting, possibly the more
        valuable because a lot of time has been spent working on
        that casting up to the stage at which the breakage
        occurs. I suppose as a last resort spark erosion could be
        used but fortunately thanks to LBSC this has not yet been
        necessary. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        inclination of the passage from the port to to the blind
        end of the cylinder was such that the holes could be
        drilled using an extended drill from the steam chest. An
        extended drill was necessary to avoid the drill chuck
        coming into contact with the bolting face of the steam
        chest. Extended drills can be simply fabricated by
        grinding a stepped joint on the drill shank, cutting a
        matching step on a suitably sized rod, applying flux,
        binding with soft iron wire and then silver soldering the
        two together. A collection of various sizes of drill
        treated in this fashion will build up as work proceeds
        and provide a useful armoury for future use. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        had already been decided that, as the valve events of the
        model would in the early stages, prove to be somewhat
        tentative, the valve port faces would be made
        replaceable. Stainless steel was used for the faces and
        this proved to be simple to machine to the required
        degree of accuracy as it could be set up flat on the bed
        of the milling machine. Those without access to a mill
        could equally well machine the piece on the vertical
        slide. Final fixing was carried out within the steam
        chest bedding the stainless steel onto ARALDITE and
        securing the plate using purpose made, stainless steel
        countersunk screws into tapped holes in the bottom of the
        steam chest. In the event that subsequent modification to
        the porting may be required, the ARALDITE bond could be
        broken down by local application of heat. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Flanges
        were prepared for the inlet and exhaust pipes. These were
        used to locate the drilled and tapped holes for their
        fixing onto the top of the cylinder casting, these were
        then set aside for assembly onto their respective pipes
        in due course. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">CYLINDER
        COVERS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Having
        bored the cylinders and prepared the steam passages, the
        next step was to produce the cylinder covers, in the case
        of PIXIE these are of fairly substantial section with a
        nice domed centre. Machining this centre called for a lot
        of knob twiddling, a thoroughly enjoyable business.
        Achieving the correct profile was aided by the
        production, on the drawing board, of a card template
        which could be applied to check the profile between bouts
        of twiddling. Experience has shown that such profiled
        surfaces generally turn out to be less than spectacular
        due to a conservative tendency on the part of the
        machinist, reluctant to take those last few cuts that
        would make all the difference to the form of the piece.
        This springs from the memory of those ' last few cuts '
        taken in the past which have resulted in a scrapped part
        and lots of rework ! The use of a template as described
        promotes the development of the striking shapes which are
        a feature of, and provide much of the charm of, the
        narrow gauge locomotive. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        glance through any of the books which describe the motive
        power employed by the various narrow gauge and light
        railways evidences the fact that engineers in the heyday
        of steam were quite happy to spend money on ornamentation
        which would be frowned upon by the ' value engineering '
        oriented designer of today. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        covers were mounted in the three-jaw and the spigot
        prepared a good fit in the cylinder. The spigot was
        carefully filed away to provide a clear steamway to, and
        from, the steam passage. On a previous locomotive this
        step had been omitted and only remembered when on trial
        with air, when unbelievably there was no action on
        switching on the air supply. this was of course simply
        rectified, once the cause of the problem had been
        identified, although at the cost of unbolting the
        cylinder covers and breaking the then carefully made
        gaskets (that was in the days b.i.g, before instant
        gasket). Drilling for the studs followed using a template
        from thin plate material. The hole positions were
        transferred from the cover clamped into position and then
        the first hole was drilled and tapped to allow the
        insertion of a stud to immobilise the cover during the
        subsequent drilling of the remainder of the holes. The
        use of a template whilst apparently laborious is a
        worthwhile precaution as otherwise although the holes for
        the studs can be set out on the cover and transferred to
        the cylinder, with a gunmetal on gunmetal joint slip can
        easily occur. Again harking back to a previous model, the
        draughtsman had drawn equally spaced studs although with
        the cover located as drawing, one of the studs would have
        coincided with the position of one of the steam passages,
        small errors like this sometimes slip into details and
        are worth watching for. One cannot help but wonder what
        is the effect on the modeller following instructions in a
        periodical when he reads an announcement such as ' we
        regret that owing to a printers error in our last issue
        etc. etc.!' Perhaps its advisable to work a few issues in
        arrears in which case printers errors will have been
        accounted for by the time work commences on a particular
        part. In the same vein one magazine, now defunct,
        published an apology some 16 installments into a series
        on building a particular model, a note to the effect that
        they had lost touch with the writer and were seeking
        someone to complete the series! This must have had
        disastrous results ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">STEAM
        CHEST COVERS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Next
        came the preparation of the steam chest covers. This
        called for a template which was duly produced from a
        scrap of mild steel. The template was used to drill each
        cover plate in turn, including the small tapped holes for
        the metal threads used to break the gasket joint when
        access was required to the valve chest for maintenance
        purposes on full size PIXIE. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Once
        the cover plates were drilled the template was again used
        to locate the tapped holes in the cylinders, one hole
        being first drilled and tapped and a bolt inserted to
        secure the template against displacement whilst the
        remainder of the holes were spotted through. PIXIE has a
        union set in the right hand cover providing a take-off
        for a pipe to a steam chest pressure gauge, this was
        produced from a chucking piece of material from the scrap
        box. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        studs securing the steam chest cover are, on PIXIE, set
        out uniformly about the centre line of the cover. At each
        end is a small bolt, set into a tapped hole on the centre
        line. These bolts serve the important purpose of enabling
        the steam chest / cover joint to be broken when carrying
        out adjustments to valve settings. It was a delight at
        the time that the covers were required to be removed to
        be able to slacken off the lock nuts on these small
        easing bolts at the ends of the cover, then to break the
        cylinder/cylinder cover joint by screwing down the bolts.
        Although on Pixie are they are only 8 BA. they did the
        job famously. Those old engineers certainly knew their
        stuff ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">GLANDS
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Seatings
        for the valve rod gland and tail cover on each cylinder
        casting were milled and shaped from bar stock. They were
        then silver soldered into place on the cylinder casting,
        correct location being ensured by the use of short
        lengths of carbon salvaged from the bushes of a vacuum
        cleaner, turned to a push fit in each assembly. The
        carbon resists the solder whilst retaining the correct
        location and is a good example of the recycling
        activities which form a part of the writer's modelling
        activities! A good fillet of solder was formed at each
        joint to emulate those on the prototype casting. After
        the soldering operation each gland was faced up true to
        the main body of the casting. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        glands for the valve rods were turned up as circular,
        flanged bushes prior to being sawn and filed to the
        required shape. The body of the piston-rod gland is
        interesting, incorporating as it does the seating for the
        slide bar. Production of the body involved a considerable
        amount of hand-work, carried out once the the hole for
        the rod had been drilled and counter bored for the gland.
        The piston rod gland has an oilway for lubrication and is
        adjusted by two shouldered studs as is that for the valve
        rod. Rather than use conventional packings in the glands,
        ' O ' rings are preferred as these provide tightness
        whilst causing minimum friction between the parts. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        nice little detail seen in service is an oil-soaked
        length of tow which is tied to the easing bolt on the
        valve chest cover and looped around the valve rod to
        provide lubrication. Very practical, and a useful bit of
        ' colour ' to assist with the narrow gauge image ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PISTONS
        AND RODS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Pistons
        are turned from gunmetal, The piston blanks being mounted
        in the three jaw, the holes for the rods drilled and
        tapped with a 1 / 4 in M.E Thread. The thread was cut
        away using a 1 / 4 inch diameter D-bitt for half of the
        piston thickness to allow the piston rod to be drawn into
        position by its thread in the later operation of uniting
        the two parts. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Piston
        rods of silver steel were set into a simple collet in the
        three jaw. These collets are home produced from suitably
        sized slugs of metal by drilling and reaming to the
        finished diameter of the spindle or rod to be gripped.
        After marking by centre punch at No. 1 jaw to ensure
        accurate re-location the collets are then slit with a
        razor saw. As work progresses a number of useful collets
        accumulate and are be stored with the tooling ready for
        re-use as the occasion arises. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        thread for the pistons was cut with extreme care, using
        an M.E. die and ensuring that at all times the die stock
        was firmly supported square to the axis of the rod by the
        nose of the tailstock chuck. A tailstock-mounted die
        holder is of great assistance in such work and can be
        manufactured in the home workshop from a proprietary
        mandrel and some offcuts of round bar. A secondary bush
        which can be set into the space for the die, and which
        permits longer adjustment screws to pass, allows the use
        of smaller sizes of die within the main sliding die
        holder. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the rod set in the collet within the three jaw, the ends
        of the rods were lightly centre drilled prior to oil
        being placed on their threads and into the the tapped
        holes in the pistons. The pistons, gripped in a hand
        protected by rag, were then screwed onto the rods, care
        being taken that the plain portion of the rod entered
        well into the smooth, ' D-bitted ' part of the hole. Once
        the pistons were secured in this fashion the tailstock
        centre was engaged in the small centre and the pistons
        turned to finished diameter with reference to each
        cylinder bore. Each piston was then marked to ensure
        subsequent matching of the sets. It is helpful if a
        uniform system of marking is followed, centre-pops on an
        unimportant surface will suffice, say one pop for items
        on the right side of the loco and two on the left,
        looking forward from the footplate, or perhaps simpler
        still one pop for one side, and no pops for the other ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        each piston assembly still mounted in the collet and
        supported by the tailstock centre, grooves for ' O '
        rings were machined using a parting-off tool. Grooves for
        these rings must be produced to the sizes recommended by
        the makers, this being critical to achieving a sound seal
        whilst reducing frictions to a minimum. The edges of
        pistons and grooves should always be 'broken' using a
        fine file, to avoid damage to the rings as they are
        installed. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        final assembly, the piston rods are retained in the
        crosshead bushes by wedges passing through slots in both
        parts. In the case of Pixie these wedges are, in fact,
        bolts with the heads filed to simulate the ends of
        wedges. Holes for these simulated wedges were not drilled
        until their position could be accurately located at the
        time of trial assembly of the engines. Builders may wish
        to replicate the full size arrangement which may call for
        slotting the piston rod and crosshead and providing
        appropriate cotters and wedges. </font></p>

        motion plates are of course a handed pair, those on PIXIE
        are quite conventional and those for Pixie were produced
        by cutting plate to the required profile. Then the flange
        for fixing to the frame was attached by silver soldering.
        The lugs which support the trailing end of the slide bars
        were soldered into place at the same heating. Drilling
        the holes for the slide bar fixing bolt was left until
        final erection. The motion plate was trimmed with a half
        round fillet on the front face, simulating the detail on
        the prototype, this was attached using soft solder. For
        the purpose of trial assemblies the slide bar was be held
        in place using a toolmakers clamp. The location of the
        motion plate and thus the position of the fixing holes in
        the frames is best established at the time of setting out
        the motion work. </font></p>

        of which takes support from the body of the piston rod
        gland on the back of the cylinder casting. The trailing
        end is bolted to a bracket on the bottom of the motion
        plate. The slide bar itself is a piece of profiled steel,
        in the case of Pixie ground gauge plate. This was milled
        to shape and the fixing holes and countersunk lubrication
        holes drilled in conventional fashion in the drill press.

        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        PIXIE the crossheads are substantial steel boxes,
        assembled around the slide bars. Lining each box is a set
        of slippers, so shaped as to remain captive once the
        crosshead assembly is bolted up. The box is fabricated
        from three plates and a fabricated mounting, assembled by
        bolting. Incorporated in the bottom plate of the
        crosshead assembly is the mounting for the piston rod /
        coupling rod joint. This comprises a flange for the
        gudgeon pin and a boss into which the piston rod end is
        secured. The boss was first turned onto a mild steel
        blank, and was left overlength for subsequent adjustment
        when the motion was assembled. The crosshead blanks were
        then milled to profile and section, incorporating the
        bottom plate of the crosshead. Twelve bolts were
        prepared. The threads were turned from the ends of the
        bolts which were then drilled for split pins. In course
        of erection on PIXIE the leading two bolts of the
        assembly are entered from above the crosshead, the
        remainder from below. It was important that the assembly
        on Pixie replicated that employed on PIXIE, otherwise
        with all six bolts entered from the top, the projecting
        ends of the trailing bolts would have interfered with the
        movement of the coupling rod. Detail such as this must be
        studied carefully at the time of survey as each
        locomotive is likely to have some such idiosyncrasy.
        Omission of such information from the notes made at the
        time of survey could result in problems at the time of
        erection or worse, damaged parts at the time of air
        testing. </font></p>

        hole for the gudgeon pin was then drilled and a phosphor
        bronze bush pressed-in. To ensure a good fit the gudgeon
        pin is machined from silver steel, brought to a high
        finish in the lathe. As is general practice on PIXIE the
        ends of the pins are turned down and fitted with split
        pins for safety purposes. </font></p>

        are of gunmetal and provide a nice exercise in milling,
        either in the milling machine or the vertical table on
        the lathe. As with many thin or slender components it is
        worthwhile soldering, or bonding the material to a more
        substantial section of metal. This backplate can be more
        readily gripped in a vice, or if necessary, bolted to a
        faceplate or bed. In this way machining can be carried
        out without fear of a nearly finished part moving under
        the cutting effort and becoming scrap. This technique was
        adopted for the slippers which were brought to within a
        few thousandths of the calculated finished size prior to
        filing and burnishing to fit within the crosshead,
        ensuring a nice easy action. There is a tendency to make
        parts too slack a fit at this stage. It must be bourn in
        mind that the running-in process affects every part of
        the motion and parts which seem quite tight at first, or
        trial, assembly soon free-up as the running in process
        proceeds ( using plenty of lubricant of course! ) </font></p>

        there is such a word) between the piston centre line and
        the slide bar being most important for free running.
        Fortunately in the case of Pixie there was an opportunity
        in the course of the erection process to maintain this
        parallelity ( ? ) by adjusting the level of the bearing
        surfaces at the top of the glands and if necessary
        insertion of shim washers at the bracket on the lower
        edge of the motion plate. </font></p>

        GEAR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PIXIE
        is fitted with Hackworth valve gear. This gear is
        sometimes derided by pundits because vertical movement of
        the axles upsets the valve events to some extent. This
        has not proved to be too noticeable in the case of Pixie
        and indeed the Hackworth gear is employed effectively on
        what must be the hundreds of Sweet Pea locomotives,
        designed by Jack Buckler, running on club tracks about
        the country. Jack Butler contributed an excellent article
        to ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE May 1986, Volume 7, No. 12
        examining some of the criticisms and recommending methods
        of optimising performance. These include adjusting the
        height of the weighshaft and ensuring the correct ride
        position of the axle to ensure that the die block pivot
        moves equally about the weighshaft centre. In a more
        recent edition of ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE Vol 15 No.1
        June 1993 a highly technical article, almost of Ph.D.
        standard by Nigel Bennet describes the computer
        simulation of Hackworth valve gear for Edward Thomas and
        incorporates a lot of useful detail on the motion work
        for Sweet Pea. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        the case of Pixie the critical dimensions of the
        prototype were replicated as accurately as possible and
        in the air trials these worked satisfactorily. no doubt
        the events could be fine tuned in light of Messrs
        Bucklers and Bennetts discussions, and maybe they will,
        when time permits perhaps. Meanwhile Pixie's performance
        is quite satisfactory with her replicated sizes
        incorporated. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Hackworth
        gear takes its motion from the return crank fixed
        directly opposite the crank pin i.e. on a line passing
        through the crankpin and centre of the axle. The
        vibrating lever attached to the return crankpin connects
        with a pivot pin on the die block which runs within
        straight guides set upon the weighshaft. With the guides
        in line with the centre of the axle the valve rod pivot
        on the vibrating lever is driven through an oval path of
        which the length of the horizontal axis equals twice the
        valve lap plus the lead. Rotating the weighshaft alters
        the inclination of the guides and changes valve events
        accordingly. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        size of the components of the valve gear was scaled down
        from the prototype and cardboard templates were employed
        at the drawing board to ensure that all would work when
        assembled onto Pixie. Whilst a spare weighshaft and
        guides was produced having extended slides for
        experimental purposes, to date these have not been
        installed. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">One
        end of the return crank blanks was drilled and bored to
        match the shouldered crankpin. The other end was drilled
        for the vibrating lever pivot pin. The blank was milled
        to shape and the pivot pin set into place using retaining
        fluid. The return crank itself was secured to the
        crankpin by a slotted and bolted connection, aided by a
        further touch of retaining fluid. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        vibrating lever on PIXIE has a small marine type bearing
        at the lower end, and two bushed holes for the die block
        and valve rod pivot pins. As with the connecting and
        coupling rods, the marine bearing permits some small
        adjustment to be made to the geometry at the time of
        final erection. The vibrating lever blank was cut from
        mild steel, the pivot holes drilled and then milled to
        final shape. When milling bosses, or indeed when shaping
        the ends of any of the rods or levers by means of an an
        end mill in the lathe or milling machine with the
        material set upon a pin, it is important to remember that
        the material must only be moved against the direction of
        the cutter. Failure to observe this will result in the
        cutter attempting to ' climb ' onto the material, the
        resulting snatch causing damage to the part or, worse,
        the operators fingers ! Phosphor bronze bushes were
        pressed into the pivot pin holes. </font></p>

        CUPS AND LOCAL LUBRICATION </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Oil
        cups are fitted at each pivot point and adjacent to the
        bearings. These oil cups like those on other narrow gauge
        locomotives add a touch of individualism, they are of
        brass, of interesting shape and can be polished, and are
        ' perched ' somewhat precariously it seems, on the
        vibrating levers and die blocks. Those on the vibrating
        lever were milled to shape prior to fitting the tubes
        which convey oil to the bearings. These tubes are fitted
        into drilled holes with just a touch of bonding fluid,
        sufficient to fix them without blocking the tubes. Each
        cup is topped with a screw plug turned from a BA bolt,
        the head being brought to profile then knurled prior to
        the arisses being removed. A small centre bitt was used
        to drill the countersunk breather holes in each plug. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        weigh shaft is of silver steel, shouldered to enter the
        back plates of the guide assemblies. The shaft is rotated
        from the reversing lever by a reach rod which is
        connected to a lug on the bottom of the right-hand guide.
        The cheeks of the guide are milled from gauge plate,
        later hardened by heating,and are attached by bolts and a
        locating pin passing through the backplate and the
        weighshaft. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        weigh shaft brackets were fabricated from steel angle and
        plate, the lower section being welded-up. The top plate
        has small seating pieces sweated into place to accomodate
        the stud nuts when the two parts are assembled. Once the
        two parts are assembled the hole for the weigh shaft can
        be drilled and reamed. The brackets are assembled onto
        the frames by bolts passing through the frames and the
        frame angles. Ideally the position of the brackets should
        be determined when the whole of the motion work has been
        completed and the valves inserted onto the rods within
        the valve chest. At this stage the correct location can
        be established by trial and error with the brackets
        clamped to the frame angles. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        modification to the guides has been suggested by Jack
        Buckler in describing ' Sweet Pea ', ENGINEERING IN
        MINIATURE. In his redesign the guides are milled from one
        block of mild steel, a slotted cover plate being attached
        by countersunk screws onto the front of the guides so
        formed. This appears to be a simpler form of construction
        and may commend itself for some models. </font></p>

        blocks are of tee section and have a shouldered pin for
        connection with the top of the eccentric rod. this pin is
        entered from the back of the die block, a further
        shoulder seating in a counterbore in the back of the
        block. An oil cup is mounted on the top of the die block.
        With a good sliding fit achieved within the guides, the

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        lever was prepared by sawing and filing from a piece of
        mild steel. The handle, with a pin for insertion into the
        top of the lever, was turned from a piece of square
        material and soldered into position. The latch block
        prepared by filing was soldered into position at the same
        heating. The latch itself was prepared by soldering a
        blade onto a square steel shaft with the top milled and
        drilled for connection to the latch lever. A small spring
        maintains the latchblade in contact with the sector
        plate. A good source of high quality springs has been
        found to be the plastic video tape case. On opening a
        defunct case one finds a number of small stainless steel
        springs also some stainless steel rollers as well as
        several self -tapping screws, all useful candidates for

        VALVES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        slide valves were machined from gunmetal, heeding LBSC's
        advice that dissimilar metals should be used for slide
        valves and portface. The blocks of gunmetal were turned
        to overall size in the four jaw, leaving a little on the
        length for final finishing work. then the cavity for
        exhaust steam was milled out using an plain end mill and
        finished with a bull-nozed bitt, care being taken to work
        within setting-out lines lightly scribed on marking blue.
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        slots for the valve rod and the recesses for the collars
        which are used in place of a buckle were milled then
        filed to shape, care being taken that the fit permitted
        the valve to slide freely from end to end of the valve
        spindle when set in the steam chest and before the
        locating bushes were installed. The face of the valve was
        rubbed on a sheet of medium wet-and- dry paper ( used dry
        ) to impart the minute scratches which, in service,
        retain a film of oil and assist in maintaining a tight
        joint under the steam pressure in the steam chest. it is
        of course important to ensure that the valve block is
        free to lift from the portface, it is held in contact
        during service by the valve chest steam pressure but has
        to be free to overcome any problems with condensate in
        the early stages of firing whilst the cylinders are cold.
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        arrangement of threaded valve rods and nuts with locknuts
        employed for fixing the valve blocks to the rods on PIXIE
        is replaced on Pixie by 4 bronze bushes ( 2 per valve
        block ) machined from hexagonal bronze bar. These bushes
        were initially secured to the valve rod by mild steel
        grub screws which whilst proving sound enough in service,
        started to rust. These have been replaced by 5 BA set
        screws machined from stainless hexagonal bar. The hexagon
        head of the set screw permits greater fixing force to be
        applied once the correct setting has been achieved than
        was possible with the earlier grub screws. These
        stainless steel screws are secured in service using a
        retaining fluid. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        general point regarding grub screws which can save
        problems with head breakage in the case of smaller sizes
        is that the body and most of the head of the screw should
        enter the tapped hole. In this way, when effort is
        applied using a screwdriver, the lobes at each side of
        the slot in the head end are supported by the walls of
        the tapped hole in the bush, wheel or whatever the screw
        is intended to secure. Where possible, when set screws or
        grub screws are used, the spindle or axle should have a
        small flat or dimple on which the tip of the screw can
        bear when tightened. The use of two screws in a bush
        permits a small drill to be passed down one tapped hole
        to form such a location whilst the bush is secured by the
        other fixing screw. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">DUMMY
        SLIDE VALVES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As
        an aid to determining slide valve dimensions, valve
        setting and visualising the events of the slide valve
        assembly the modeller may care to make a pair of dummy
        slide valves. These can be simply prepared using 1 / 8
        inch perspex sheet. The exhaust cavity position can be
        scribed on the base and further piece of perspex cemented
        vertically onto the ' valve '. The upright can be drilled
        for the valve rod and the valve spindle installed in the
        usual fashion, using grub screws or whatever fixing is
        favoured. Whatever the final arrangement for securing the
        actual valves to the spindle, for the dummy assembly two
        bushes fitted with grub screws allow trial settings. With
        the dummy valves set in place the engines can be taken
        through their cycle and, with the length of the valve
        scribed on the perspex, the valving checked out. This
        arrangement has proved particularly helpful in the case
        of Pixie where the motion was constructed to dimensions
        taken from survey and small innaccuracies arising in
        construction called for some adjustment of the valve
        lengths to achieve optimum performance. Where a model is
        being built to proven details this eventuality should not
        arise although it is still most interesting to see the
        valves in motion and to visualise the events. </font></p>

        SPINDLES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        valve spindles are lengths of rustless steel, their ends
        terminate in bosses which are turned to shape, drilled
        and reamed for phosphor bronze bushes prior to being
        silver soldered into place. After the soldering process
        the bores are cleaned up by a pass of the reamer and a
        small bush pressed into place in each. When working on
        bushes of this size, the bore of the bush is often
        reduced by this squeezing action and require a pass of
        the reamer to bring them back to size. Small oil cups are
        mounted on the top of each bush, a fine hole being
        drilled to convey the 'amber liquid' to the bearing face.

        are from silver steel with mild steel forks soldered at
        each end. The forks are profiled by milling and filing.
        Milling the rounded ends is carried out on a pin mounted
        in the small 4 jaw chuck attached to a baseplate which
        can be bolted onto the table of the milling machine.
        Prior to the aquisition of the milling machine such work
        was carried out using a pin mounted in a machine vice
        secured to the vertical table. In each case care has to
        be taken to avoid climb milling with resulting snatch on
        the part. Prior to installing the valve rods onto the
        locomotive the silver steel pins were fitted into the
        forks and holes for split pins were drilled through fork
        and pin. A very small drill was used, run at the highest
        speed obtainable on the drilling machine. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Work
        of this nature is carried out on a sensitive drill
        constructed from a set of castings purchased from MESSRS
        REEVES of Birmingham. The drill formed an exercise in
        machining and boring and building the drill served to
        teach many a lesson. The result is a drill with which
        minute holes of considerable depth can be drilled with
        confidence, an extended arm controlling the movement of
        the quill giving a very direct ' feel ' right to that
        critical point where the drill breaks through on the
        underside of the material. One small amendment made to
        the design of the machine is the addition of a perspex
        guard around the twin pulleys driving the quill. One's
        face is often quite near to this area when concentrating
        on that last, critical hole in some assembly that
        represents some hours of work, and a broken drive belt
        could seriously damage a person's good looks ! Prior to
        building the sensitive drill I used an auxiliary drill
        chuck set in the lathe and used in conjunction with a
        drill-pad set in the tailstock, feed being achieved by
        the tailstock handwheel. This is quite an exciting
        operation, particularly with the lathe turning at top
        speed to suit the smaller number drills. Drama can result
        if, with the Super 7 and its self-ejecting mechanism, the
        drill-pad reaches the point of ejection before the bitt
        reaches the bottom of the hole ! </font></p>

        setting was carried out at the appropriate stage in the
        erection process. The best description that we have
        encountered in any book is that by LBSC in his account of
        building ' TICH '. As he always did, old LBSC describes
        the process in the simplest of terms, and there seems
        little point in repeating any but the key points here.
        these are basically that the 'crack ' of the port must
        occur on each dead centre In the case of the Hackforth
        valve gear, the inclination of the guides on the
        weighshaft determine the amount of the port opening.
        Unfortunately, compared with the Walschaerts' gear there
        is no combination lever to hasten the opening of the
        ports to exhaust, inlet and exhaust taking place at
        similar pace. This has not proved to be a problem in
        practice however and the little locomotive has ample
        pulling power. </font></p>

        set-up on the right of the foot plate although in some
        previous period it has been sited on the left. At
        footplate level the standard is based upon an oval plate
        and incorporates two angle steel supports between this
        plate and the standard proper. At the top a bracket takes
        support from the frame of the rear weatherboard. Near the
        top of the rod and within an enlarged section of the
        standard is a collar which, being pinned to the shaft,
        acts as a bearing resisting the thrust as braking effort
        is applied by rotating the brake handle clockwise. As the
        force set up by putting the brake off is relatively
        small, a keeper plate, retained by small round head
        screws tapped into the top face of the standard, is
        sufficiently substantial to provide a bearing surface.
        this is one of the few places in railway mechanical
        engineering that such screws are encountered. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        rod passes through the footplate into a substantial bush
        set in the fork of the actuating lever. the thread on
        PIXIE is of course a buttressed thread, that on Pixie, a
        ' common or garden ' Whitworth thread... we did say that
        Pixie was a near-scale model ! The brakeshaft sits in two
        bushes bolted to the frames. Actuating rods form a
        connection between cranks on the brakeshaft and
        transverse rods passing through clearance holes in the
        bottom of the brake hangers. The actuating rods are
        maintained in the correct transverse position by bushes
        and split pins, some allowance for adjustment to the
        brake set-up is provided by a series of holes in the back
        end of the actuating rods. </font></p>

        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        smokebox was turned from a piece of steam barrel, not on
        first sight a prepossessing piece of material. Turning in
        the four jaw revealed an immaculate piece of high quality
        steel however and this was soon brought to the correct
        diameter and length. Before removal from the lathe, lines
        were scribed longitudinally onto marking fluid on the
        outer surface at 90 degrees intervals as a guide for use
        later in setting out the position of the chimney, the
        openings for the steam and exhaust pipes, and importantly
        the holes for the bolts which are used to connect the
        smokebox to the saddle. This marking was aided by using
        the simple dividing attachment described later in the
        book, the lines being scribed using a point tool in the
        topslide tool holder and traversing the saddle. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        position of the hole for the chimney was next established
        and marked out, again using marking fluid. The tube was
        then set on end and clamped to the saddle with packing
        such that the centre of the hole was on the axis of the
        lathe. The hole was started using a centre bitt, followed
        by a succession of drill bitts up to the largest
        available, finally being brought to size using a boring
        tool mounted in the four-jaw chuck. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Two
        pieces of ply were bandsawn to the profile of the outer
        diameter of the smokebox tube. Spaced by a block of wood
        these permitted the location of the tube, on its side, on
        the table of the drilling machine. Where just a few
        operations are to be carried out, such an arrangement,
        whilst quickly produced is adequate in providing a sound
        support. If there were a number of similar operations
        something more substantial would be employed. Apertures
        for the steam and exhaust pipes were then set out. These
        openings were formed by chain drilling and some careful
        work with ' junior ' hacksaws. The ends of the saws being
        wrapped with insulating tape to avoid damage to the
        inside of the smokebox tube. Two saws were used, one the
        common ' junior ' saw with the blade parallel to the
        handle, the other with the frame cranked through 90
        degrees enabling the cuts around the perimeter of the
        tube to be made. The edges of the openings were finished
        by filing. Holes for the bolts securing the smokebox to
        the saddle were then set out and drilled, still using the
        ply cradle to support the tube, these would be
        subsequently transferred to the top of the saddle
        casting. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SMOKEBOX
        DOOR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        disk of 'mild steel' yielded the smokebox door, after a
        fight that was ! The blank proved to be extremely hard,
        possibly as a result of some long-past cropping
        operation. This is a problem sometimes encountered when
        ones material comes from scrapboxes, breakers yards and
        similar sources, although a problem which will not be
        encountered by modelmakers who patronise the trade
        supplying ' bona fide ' model engineering materials ! The
        result was that having taken the edge off, and the temper
        out of, several tools it became necessary to set up
        green-grit grinding wheel in a power drill and having
        protected the lathe bed with rags, applying this to the
        blank as it rotated in the lathe. Unorthodox as this may
        have been, it did the trick. Fortunately there was no
        hard spot in the centre of the piece, and after drilling
        the blank was mounted on a bolt whilst the inner face was
        relieved to leave just a small ' land ' which would
        ensure a good seal on the front smokebox ring. What LBSC
        would have described as a ' nobby ' handle, and what the
        writer sees as a Victorian cupboard door handle is
        screwed into the central hole to complete the door. Other
        prototypes employ darts and crossbars with perhaps keys
        and locking handles, these provide some exercise in
        watchmaking. Crossbars to retain the dart are seated into
        brackets rivetted to the front smokebox ring. These are
        not needed on Pixie as the door is retained by two angle
        steel brackets and ball handles </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SMOKEBOX
        RINGS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        PIXIE, as on a number of narrow gauge locomotives, the
        smokebox front is a piece of plate mounted on the firebox
        by a rolled steel angle. this arrangement is represented
        on Pixie by using a one-piece gunmetal casting turned to
        profile. Dummy bolts in the front face represent those
        connecting the plate and ring of the prototype. Such an
        arrangement often proves simpler in model form than would
        fabrication using separate components, in this case it
        makes the sealing of the firebox easier to achieve. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        plaster pattern had been prepared for the smokebox ring
        castings. The pattern was ' horsed ' as described earlier
        and yielded the two castings which, whilst crude,
        contained the necessary material. The rings were prepared
        by first machining the external form with the casting
        set-up on the reversed jaws of the four jaw chuck. The
        outer face of the front ring was turned to a snug fit
        within the smokebox tube, leaving the small projection
        which simulated the thickness of the front plate where it
        laps over the front edge of the tube. Set-ups of this
        type must be approached with care as thermal expansions
        tend to loosen the grip of the chuck. Frequent checking
        is essential. With the outer edges machined, the face and
        inner section of the casting could be brought to profile.
        This was carried out with the ring gripped within the
        jaws of the chuck, here again care is required to avoid
        distorting the now quite slender ring whilst tightening
        the chuck. The back ring was turned to a neat fit within
        the tube then set aside until the inside diameter could
        be ascertained from the boiler. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        front ring was next drilled for the bolts which on the
        prototype connect the front plate and the annular angle.
        The twenty bolts are installed nut outside, one shares
        the duty of supporting the lamp iron at the top in front
        of the chimney. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">HINGE
        PLATE, LUGS, PINS AND CATCHES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Mild
        steel plate was used for the hinge plate. In order that
        the back face could be turned to match the form of the
        door the blank was cut to rough outline and set up on a
        faceplate. A secure fixing was obtained by using bolts
        screwed into tapped holes in parts of the hinge plate
        which would later be machined away. With a good fit
        obtained between the hinge plate and the outer face of
        the door, the blank was filed to profile. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">To
        ensure the airtight joint essential to good draughting
        under steam, care must be taken with the geometry of the
        hinge points. A few minutes work with pencil and card
        will reveal that the hinge point must be so placed that
        the door opens both outwards and away from the front ring
        of the smokebox. It may be necessary to slightly relieve
        the edge of the door adjacent to the hinge to ensure
        clearance. Once the geometry has been resolved the hinge
        plate can be milled or filed to final profile and
        rivetted onto the door. The hinge lugs are filed up to
        shape from square mild steel, set into the four jaw and
        turned to accept a thread. A bright steel hinge pin is
        lightly tapered at one end and fitted with a collar. The
        lugs can be slipped onto the pin which is passed through
        the hinge plate and the whole offered-up to the front
        ring. It may prove necessary at this stage to make some
        small adjustment to the shoulders on the lugs to bring
        the perimeter of the door into contact with the front
        plate to ensure the essential airtight joint when the
        door is closed. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Twin
        steel angle brackets secure Pixie's door in the closed
        position. These are mounted on studs set into the
        smokebox front ring and are tightened by two ' ball
        headed nuts ', which present a nice piece of ornamental
        turning. This is an example where a note on the survey
        sketch would have resulted in a more authentic model,
        these ball handles appear on later inspection to be of
        gunmetal and not mild steel as reproduced ! The
        manufacture of these handles was however most a enjoyable
        exercise. The profiles were generated offhand, using a
        bar clamped under the MYFORD tool clamp as a tool
        support. After parting off the blanks with a ball at each
        end were set into the drilling machine vice, sandwiched
        between two scaps of steel having countersunk holes to
        provide a locating grip for the blanks. With the blanks
        set to the correct angle the larger ball was then drilled
        ad tappped for the stud which is set into the front face
        of the smokebox. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WET
        HEADER </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        wet header was turned from a piece of gunmetal rod, it
        sits in a bush soldered into the smokebox tubeplate.
        Three stainless steel bolts pass through the header into
        holes tapped into the boiler bush. The steam pipe ( from
        the regulator ) enters the header and the joint is sealed
        by an ' O ' ring. A small diameter pipe from the
        lubricator delivers oil into the steam at this point.
        Whilst generally this is done by inserting tees into the
        steam pipes nearer the cylinders or by means of
        displacement lubricators mounted on the steam chest
        covers, the current arrangement appears to be
        satisfactory and does not lead to priming as the steam
        ports of the Stroudley type regulator are set high in the
        steam dome and thus considerably above the level of the
        outlet at the header. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">STEAM,
        BLAST AND PETTICOAT PIPES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After
        careful annealing, the steam pipes were bent to shape and
        fitted with the flanges to connect with the cylinder
        casting. The flanges were silver soldered to the pipes
        and care was required to ensure the correct orientation
        of these flanges to suit the location of the fixing studs
        in the cylinder block. The upper ends were then soldered
        into the wet header during the same heating as the
        lubricator pipe. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Exhaust
        steam pipes were formed from 1 / 2 inch diameter copper
        pipe which had to be annealed frequently in the course of
        producing the reverse bends between the cylinder block
        and the connection for the blower ring. A jig was
        prepared replicating the actual position of the holes in
        the cylinder casting for the blast pipes and the proposed
        location of the blower ring, determined by the type of
        ring selected. The connection between the twin exhaust
        pipes was filed up from two pieces of mild steel, the two
        halves were clamped together and the holes for connecting
        bolts drilled. The assembled joint was then drilled and
        tapped for the installation of the combined blast pipe
        and blower nozzle and a small slug of metal prepared to
        fair-in the joint and improve the flow of steam once the
        joint is assembled. The parts were all assembled into the
        jig and the flange and connecting block joints were all
        soldered at one heating. In the case of all flanged
        connections the flanges are prepared as a pair and then
        used to spot the holes for the fixing bolts. a centre
        popped mark ensures that the flanges are used where
        intended and thus minor discrepancies in hole centres are
        overcome. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">BLOWER
        RING </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As
        the ring on PIXIE is a loop of small diameter tubing and
        replication in model form would not perhaps have provided
        a satisfactory draught, a rather more sophisticated type
        of blast ring was incorporated. This took the form of of
        a combined blast nozzle and blower with an annular
        chamber around the nozzle pierced by very small holes to
        provide the blower jets. The arrangement has been
        detailed in several articles in the technical press over
        the years. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PETTICOAT
        PIPE </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        piece of copper pipe from a recent domestic plumbing job
        was annealed ready for spinning. The pipe was plugged at
        one end to avoid distortion in the three jaw, the other
        end was then spun-up to a push fit in the chimney base
        using a polished piece of silver steel supported from a
        piece of stock bar clamped into the tool holder. The
        first plug was removed and the newly expanded end was
        plugged then spun. Frequent annealing permitted the
        eventual achievement of the required form. On erection
        the petticoat pipe would be fixed using a smear of
        instant gasket. </font></p>

        - HOME BUILD Vs PROPRIETARY SUPPLY </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Tackled
        systematically and following upon the advice of the
        masters such as L.B.S.C, Alec Farmer Martin Evans and
        Keith Wilson the task of boiler construction is within
        the capability of most model engineers. Where possible
        the modelmaker will be wise to enlist the assistance of
        an experienced person in constructing his first boiler,
        in the case of the writer this person was a dear old
        gentleman who had for many years been employed in all
        types of plate fabrication and jointing using welding,
        brazing and soldering and many different techniques for a
        range of materials. The following comment arises from
        experience in building that first boiler, the advice
        recieved from the aforementioned old gentleman who
        provided me with the basics of soldering practice. Other
        people have joined evening classes or attended short
        courses held during the vacation at various Universities
        and colleges. Usually these events are organised and
        staffed by experienced technicians prepared to guide
        participants through the tricky parts of the operation.
        They also provide access to that most important
        ingredient of good boilermaking, the substantial heat
        source. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        keys to successful boiler building are, a proven design,
        care in obtaining good fits between parts, absolute
        cleanliness, and an adequate heat source. Given these
        essentials together with space and time the beginner can
        produce what L.B.S.C described as the ' kettle ' for
        their locomotive. In the case of Pixie, experience gained
        in producing the boiler for an earlier 3 1 / 2&quot;
        gauge locomotive had convinced the writer of the
        difficulty of providing sufficient heat using existing
        equipment, both propane and butane torches. To avoid
        problems, and economise on time available for model
        engineering work, the decision was made to sublet the
        boiler construction. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This
        proved to be a wise decision and should there be any
        doubt in the modellers mind as to whether he can afford
        the equipment or obtain the necessary support and
        assistance, he would do well to consider obtaining a
        ready-made boiler from one of the many experts
        advertising in the trade journals. In this case it may
        only be necessary to phone several suppliers to obtain a
        quotation for a boiler for a specific model to a
        published design. Various well known specialist suppliers
        spring to mind and one cannot go far wrong in purchasing
        from any of these. Although there are a few widely known
        suppliers, prior knowledge passed on by a fellow club
        member may direct ones choice to another fabricator who
        although perhaps not so widely known has proved his
        ability in a previous supply. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Non-standard
        boilers such as that required for Pixie call for a
        slightly different approach. Here, whilst the overall
        dimensions are known, the design of the boiler and its
        staying is best left to a builder with with a proven
        track record. After obtaining several ' budget ' figures
        it was decided to employ a boilermaker with an excellent
        record, although the budget price quoted was not the
        lowest. The fact that the builder had for many years
        manufactured a range of standard boilers, so much so that
        his firm had a ' household name ', generated confidence.
        As well as being approachable the proprietor was
        exceedingly knowledgeable and was most helpful in
        assisting with design input. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Armed
        with outline details, especially critical dimensions of
        items such as the location of the tank support brackets,
        firehole door, steam fountain and dome, arrangements were
        made for a meeting at the firms stand at the MODEL
        ENGINEERING EXHIBITION. Here the boilermaker advised upon
        such matters as the number and location of tubes, size
        and bore of bushes, desirability or otherwise, in fact
        otherwise, of superheater and so on. After the meeting
        these details were transferred to a finished drawing on
        which the final quotation was to be based. At this stage
        the builder knew exactly what was expected of him and as
        a result could provide an accurate quotation of what the
        cost would be, an essential to a satisfactory business
        deal. Here it should be bourn in mind that money that we
        spend on a boiler today would, a few years ago, have
        purchased quite a reasonable motor car ! Boilers from
        commercial suppliers come with a boiler test certificate
        which must not be confused with the certificate required
        by clubs where the locomotive is to be run. The
        certificate simply indicates the pressure contained
        during a raw test, probably before the bushes were
        drilled out to tapping size. Although the criteria vary
        from club to club, officials will require more stringent
        testing, including the efficiency of the safety valves,
        before they issue a club certificate. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        the event that the model engineer decides to go it alone,
        it makes sense, in the case of a standard model for which
        designs have been published, to make use of the ready
        flanged plate service offered by many suppliers. This
        will save a lot of time and, whilst costing more than
        obtaining the raw material and flanging up over hardwood
        or mild steel formers, can prove more economic in time,
        and material. The price of flanged plates can be
        maintained at an economic level because as well as
        re-using the formers many times in the course of
        production, the proprietary supplier has a better chance
        of planning his material usage in the course of a
        production run. He can work far more economically than
        does the individual attempting to cut a set of plates
        from his one piece of sheet copper. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">CONSTRUCTION
        TECHNIQUES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        first class boiler, and we must not settle for anything
        less, demands excellent materials. These will be found in
        the catalogues of the proprietary suppliers to the hobby.
        With the materials to hand, the plates must be set out in
        the most economic fashion. Here paper templates are
        essential, these can be shuffled around on the raw
        material to provide a best fit and thus the utmost
        economy in material. The lines are best transferred to
        the material using a waterproof overhead projector pen.
        In this way scribing is avoided at this stage and the
        lines can be simply erased using a rag soaked in
        methylated spirits. Where essential the lines can be
        lightly scribed once the best layout has been achieved. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">To
        cut the plating material obtain the largest pair of snips
        possible, grip one handle in the vice and slip a piece of
        pipe of suitable diameter over the other. With this
        arrangement, not only can considerable force be applied
        when necessary, but also very small cuts can be made
        slowly with great precision. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst
        the platework can be prepared using the range of hand
        tools owned by most model engineers there are one or two
        additional tools which can make platework easier. a
        planishing hammer, a cross faced hammer and a large pair
        of tongs, mine are in fact medical forceps as used in
        delivering babies ! Plumbers gland or automotive pump
        pliers are useful for grasping hot metal. Also overlever
        wrenches such as the ' MOLE ' wrench make useful quick
        release clamps. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When
        flanging, anneal plate frequently by heating to a medium
        red then plunging it into cold water. The tendency to
        take a plate ' just a little bit further ' before
        annealing must be avoided as cracks will result due to
        work hardening of the metal. When preparing the tube
        holes in the tubeplates, countersink the holes, roughen
        the edges of the holes and file small nicks in the
        periphery of the hole to promote the flow of solder into
        the joint and around the tube. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Where
        it is necessary to drill copper plate for tubes, bushes
        and the like, Alec F. Farmer suggests a useful dodge
        which will be appreciated anyone having experienced the
        snatch of a drill as it breaks through the material. He
        recommends that drill bitts for copper plate should be
        ground in such a way that the tips cut the plate almost
        in the manner of a trepanning cut and so that the lips of
        the drill remove a curl of swarf from within this cut.
        The point of the drill seats within a pilot hole drilled
        after the centre of the hole has been set-out an
        positively spotted using a centre punch. </font></p>

        THE BOILER PARTS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        the matter of soldering one can do no better than to read
        ( and view in the series of more than 300 photographs )
        the advice of Alec F. Farmer. Not the least of the tips
        passed on in this treatise, 'Model Locomotive Boiler
        Making' is the mixture that Alec uses when making up
        flux. He uses 2 heaped TABLESPOONFULS of flux powder, a 1
        / 4 TEASPOONFUL of household detergent and mixes these to
        a creamy consistency with water. Using this mixture we
        are told that the detergent breaks down the surface
        tension of the liquid, ensuring penetration into the
        joint as well as degreasing the components being
        soldered, the greases being replaced by flux and then
        burnt off. As well as adding the detergent to the flux
        paste, cleaning and degreasing of components, prior to
        painting on the flux, has been found to provide the best
        results. With the joint painted with flux and the metal
        quickly brought to red heat. the flux will be seen to
        glaze and melt. The solder stick or wire, applied with
        the metal at this temperature, will melt and flash into
        joints. If blobs appear these have to be dispersed using
        a scratch, a wire ground to a point and bent through a
        right angle at the end. The solder will flow to the
        hottest parts of the joint and can be drawn along by
        judicious heating. Once a bright line of solder is
        apparent along or around the joint the parts can be
        allowed to cool before immersion in pickle. Final
        cleaning of soldered joints is best carried out using
        steel wool or scouring powder, after 1 / 2 an hour or so
        in pickle. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Firebricks
        as a wall around the hearth which is banked up with
        crushed firebrick maintain all available heat in the
        soldering process around the parts being worked on. A
        useful source of firebrick is the redundant storage
        heater. If it should be necessary to purchase bricks then
        a local laboratory supply company will generally stock
        the genuine article. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        is advisable to have a trial assembly of as much of the
        boiler as possible ' dry '. Holes can then be drilled, in
        key positions, for small rivets to hold the parts firmly
        during the soldering operations that follow. The pundits
        have always advised the use of differing grades of solder
        for the ongoing soldering operations to avoid spoiling
        joints made earlier. Due to the way in which the solder
        amalgamates with the copper in the course of the
        soldering process whilst advisable this is however, not
        essential. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FIREHOLE
        DOOR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Arrangements
        had been made at the time of ordering Pixie's boiler for
        the provision of blind bushes for later attachment of the
        firehole door hinge plate ( Care being taken to ensure
        that these were set on the correct side of the firehole
        ring ), also a bush for the spur. The firehole door with
        its hinge incorporating two shaped gusset pieces was set
        in place and clamped in the closed position against the
        firehole ring. With the hinge plate, again fabricated
        from mild steel located within the projecting gussets the
        hinge pin position could be marked and the hole for the
        pin drilled in the door gussets. At that stage the fixing
        bush positions were transferred to the hinge plate, the
        plate drilled and the hole positions spotted through to
        the bushes which were in their turn drilled and tapped.
        The spur for the latch, profiled from a piece of mild
        steel, was set into the four jaw for the end to be turned
        and threaded for insertion into the bush on the boiler.
        At this stage the latch lever could be cut to shape and
        brought to thickness, ensuring a good fit in the spur
        with the door closed tightly. A baffle was then cut to
        size which allowed it to pass through the firehole ring
        without binding when mounted, using a small parallel
        collar to space it from the door proper. On Pixie a small
        length of chain is used to lift the latch. In practice it
        is more likely lifted by the fireman's shovel, however
        the chain is provided and as on the prototype it
        terminates in a ring through the small shelf above the
        firehole door </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">.
        CLEADING </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There
        has been considerable discussion in the model press
        regarding the insulation values of available materials.
        For Pixie the asbestos replacement material supplied by
        the trade has proved successful. The material was easy to
        cut to pattern, did not stretch or distort in the course
        of handling and installation and was sufficiently rigid
        to remain firmly in place until the cleading material was
        fitted and the boiler bands set in place. In shaping the
        material the use of patterns is essential, it takes but a
        few minutes with paper and scissors to produce quite
        accurate patterns, indeed the lady of the house may well
        find that this is an area where she can make a
        contribution ! The material is best cut on a sheet of
        hardboard using a sharp knife or a scalpel. Prior to
        installing the cleading the insulation can be held in
        place around the boiler using soft iron wire or even the
        plastic coated wire sold for use in the garden. These
        wires serve as an extra pair of hands and can be snipped
        away after the cleading is in place. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        further set of patterns are required for the cleading
        plates. It is important when cutting the plate material
        to remember to allow for the overlap at the joint. The
        time honoured method of using snips, with one of the
        handles secured in the vice and a piece of pipe on the
        other, makes short work of the straight cuts. A nibbler
        is fine for this job although it may be worthwhile
        protecting the metal from scoring by laying sellotape
        along the line of the cut. For curves and for the
        formation of the large diameter holes for boiler
        fittings, chain drilling and a sharp chisel will suffice
        or, rather more laboriously, a metal cutting blade in the
        saw frame. Precautions are required to avoid scoring or
        burring the metal and particularly, forming creases which
        will prove impossible to remove. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        the case of Pixie a supply of half-hard brass was
        available, this was used although the pundits advise
        using thin mild steel Although the material is a kindly
        one in use and tin snips can be used for cutting it to
        shape, care has to be taken in installation to avoid a
        local sharp bend which can produce an irremovable crease
        in the plate. Attempts to remove such a crease will only
        emphasize it so it is best left alone, that is if the
        builder can live with it, otherwise that piece should be
        set aside for a less visible use and a new plate
        prepared. In the absence of bending rolls, and few of us
        are fortunate enough to possess these, a variety of
        formers can be used to roll the plate, clean scaffold
        tube, preferably the lightweight variety, even a jam jar
        has been pressed ( with care ) into service, work being
        carried out on a piece of carpet to preserve the face of
        the material. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        boiler bands are fairly straightforward provided that the
        correct length is first established using a piece of wire
        wrapped around the cleading which is temporarily held in
        place by wires, as was the insulation. Small sections of
        angle steel, drilled for the fixing bolts are rivetted
        and soldered to the ends of the boiler bands, remembering
        to leave a tongue of the band projecting beyond one of
        the angles to maintain the line of the banding. With the
        bands assembled, the wires temporarily retaining the
        cleading plating can be snipped allowing the bands to do
        the job for which they are designed. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">One
        of the attractions of locomotives large or small is the
        profusion of pipework, both in copper and brass. Much of
        this is visible and can be polished, adding to the aura
        of a model. When preparing runs of pipe, once their
        routing has been established it is advisable to replicate
        the pipe using a length, or lengths, of fairly stiff
        wire. Straightened out, the wire(s) will give an accurate
        length measurement which would otherwise be difficult to
        achieve. Many of the pipes on PIXIE have a joiner in
        mid-run, this is helpful when it comes to erection when
        the two lengths of a pipe can be installed, sometimes a
        fiddley job, the joiner inserted and the pipes coupled
        up. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">L.B.S.C.
        had a lot to say about pipes and unions and there can be
        little doubt that he was right to ridicule the overlarge
        unions seen on many standard gauge models on 3 1/2 inch
        gauge track. His solution was to solder the cone directly
        onto the pipe thus avoiding union linings which have of
        necessity to be of such a diameter that the pipe can be
        entered into them. Size is not such a problem in 2 1/2
        inch scale and on Pixie linings incorporating the cone
        are soldered onto the pipe ends. This soldering is best
        carried out by applying the heat to the inside of the
        lining whilst touching the fluxed outside of the pipe and
        lining with 1 / 16&quot; diameter rod of silver solder. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">GLAND
        NUTS AND UNION NUTS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Gland
        nuts for valves will be of standard sizes and a number
        should be fabricated for stock. A small recess cut with a
        minute boring tool will form the locating groove for an
        'O' ring seal adjacent to the butress end of the nut,
        steam or water tightness can be achieved with just the
        slightest turn of the nut on the Model Engineer thread. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Gland
        and union nuts are made from appropriately sized
        hexagonal brass bar. The bar is first centered from the
        tailstock then drilled using the appropriate bitt for the
        thread employed. Model Engineer threads are used
        universally for fittings and a glance at any catalogue
        will indicate the appropriate size of threads for
        specific pipe sizes. It is worthwhile making up a ' D '
        bitt to complete this stage of the work and provide a
        square face to the buttress. Next drill a few thousandths
        of an inch larger than the diameter of the pipe is taken
        just beyond the overall length of the nut. Tapping is
        carried out with the tap supported by the tailstock
        centre, finishing with a plug tap. A touch with a a
        chamfer tool or a smooth file ( with a good handle )
        applies the chamfers and the piece is completed by
        parting-off. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">UNION
        LINERS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Making
        liners is an enjoyable job, especially where a four tool
        turret is available ( and if it isn' t, now is a good
        time to make one! ) The angle setting of the chamfer tool
        forming the cone on the liner can be set from a
        centre-bitt mounted in the tailstock drill chuck and once
        set can remain in position until a batch of work is
        complete. A knife tool is set into another position in
        the holder. With a parting tool set in the rear tool post
        production can commence. A length of brass bar of
        diameter which will just enter the thread to be cut in
        the union nut is set in the 3 jaw, centred and drilled
        from the tailstock chuck, using firstly a centre-bitt
        then a drill of the diameter of the pipe bore. The hole
        is taken rather deeper than the turned and shouldered
        length of the lining plus the length of the cone. This is
        to ensure a through hole after parting-off. Next a drill
        of the a few thousandths of an inch greater than the
        outside diameter of the pipe is taken down to the line of
        the eventual shoulder, this provides a positive stop for
        the pipe end. The parallel portion of the liner is now
        turned to a diameter a fraction under that of the hole in
        the buttress face of the union nut. The chamfer tool is
        plunged in leaving a short length of the original
        diameter between the cone and the shoulder. The parting
        off tool completes the job, bringing the cone to length.
        If the dial readings are noted as the first component is
        made then manufacture of a batch of linings becomes
        almost automatic. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">UNION
        OLIVES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Small
        cones or olives can be used where it is required to
        reduce the overall size of a union or connector. From the
        range of copper tube available it is usually possible to
        select one that is a sliding fit on the size of pipe to
        be connected or secured. To obtain the correct cone angle
        a chamfer tool can be set to a centre bit in the
        headstock drill chuck. Several cones can be produced in
        quick succession from the copper tube held in the three
        jaw chuck. A sharp tool and high speed will be required
        to avoid distorting the tube, particularly when parting
        off which should be done leaving a small shoulder. These
        cones soldered into place on the tube, using the merest
        touch of solder require very little force on the union
        nut to achieve a tight joint. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">VALVE
        BODIES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Manufacture
        of valves is quite a time consuming operation and some
        builders may wish to buy theirs from the trade. It is
        always difficult to get exactly what is required for a
        specific prototype however and the following should prove
        helpful to those who wish, or are forced, to have a go
        for themselves. Trade suppliers market useful material
        for the body of valves in the form of tees and double-tee
        castings. These save the constructor the trouble of
        building-up bodies from bar or rod. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        this stage a set of tapped bushes will prove to be most
        useful. Produced in the three jaw, drilled, tapped and
        marked for number one jaw in a series of Model Engineer
        thread sizes, these bushes permit bodies to be mounted
        securely for turning and drilling operations without
        thread damage. The set of bushes, which should include 3
        / 16, 1 / 4 and 5 / 16 sizes as a minimum, can be set
        aside and re-used, so that time spent in their
        manufacture will be amply repaid as work proceeds on
        further models . The valve body casting can mounted in
        the four jaw, the first end to be threaded centered and
        lined with the axis of the lathe. This can be achieved by
        centre punching the approximate centre of the spigot,
        lodging this on a centre set in the tailstock and then
        lining-up the body by adjusting the chuck jaws, the
        tailstock can then be withdrawn. With the body thus set
        the outside diameter of the body can be machined as far
        as the intersection of the limbs of the valve. The limb
        can be brought to length, centre drilled and a hole
        drilled a slight clearance over the pipe size. A suitable
        size of centre bit can then be used to form an internal
        chamfer to suit the liner. The external thread for the
        gland nut can now be cut, ideally using a tailstock die
        holder. In the absence of a tailstock die holder the nose
        of a tailstock drill chuck can be brought along to bear
        on the back of a standard diestock to maintain the
        correct line of thread. With the body still mounted in
        the mandrel the hole for the valve spindle can be drilled
        to the required depth and the body tapped to suit the
        spindle. Once one limb of a casting has been threaded
        externally it is a simple matter to mount it in one of
        the previously prepared mandrels, set in the three jaw
        chuck for further turning and completion of the other
        limb(s) ready for union nuts. With all limbs completed it
        becomes matter of a few minutes work with a succession of
        files to complete the body profile. For this operation
        the valve body, still in the mandrel can be transferred
        to a vice or the chuck set on the mounting plate
        described in the chapter on simple tools and attachments.

        SPINDLES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">These
        are generally made from rustless steel and are best made
        several at a time. A length of material set in the three
        jaw and fine turned to the appropriate spigot diameter.
        this may if required be coned using a smooth, flat file.
        Threading is carried out using the tailstock die holder
        or a diestock supported from a tailstock drill chuck. The
        neck of the spindle can then be turned to diameter and,
        if required, the end filed square for attachment of the
        valve wheel. An accurate square section can be achieved
        using the simple indexing attachment described later.
        After parting off, if the valve wheel is to be fitted
        permanently, the gland nut should assembled onto the
        spindle before the end is swaged or punched. Where the
        wheel is to be threaded onto the spindle sufficient
        length of thread should be allowed to enable a lock-nut
        to be fitted. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        is important to ensure that valve spindles remain captive
        in the body of the valve whilst in their open position.
        Spindles which unscrew completely from the body of the
        valve are potentially hazardous in service. Spindles can
        be rendered captive by reducing the spindle diameter
        where it passes through the gland nut such that a
        shoulder is formed beneath the ' land ' of the nut. When
        the valve spindle is unscrewed this shoulder bears
        against the buttress so formed, preventing its complete
        withdrawal. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Those
        who manufacture their own valves will be faced with the
        production of valve wheels that convey the spirit of the
        prototype. There have been several methods suggested in
        the model press and the following are though to provide
        convincing wheels. A.G Neville in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 146,
        No 3644 described a method using six lengths of thick
        walled tube, silver soldered around the circumference of
        a central tube. These were held in place for the
        soldering operation by soft iron wire. Succeeding
        operations were to part off suitable lengths for
        individual wheels, lightly countersink the holes and file
        the rim to required final section. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">LBSC
        describes a method of building ' cool ' wheels where a
        coiled wire is soldered around the periphery of a turned
        brass wheel centre. Requiring considerable care in
        production this does produce a good looking and effective
        wheel. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        person coming new to model engineering will do well to
        buy a few nuts and cones, or even a complete valve to
        serve as patterns for their plumbing work. From these the
        general proportions can be gauged rather more easily than
        from the many drawings that are published in the model
        press. Of course the fanatic can produce fully scaled
        models of fittings if they wish, but most of us are happy
        with conventional model fittings. as has been said
        before, we set our own standards to suit our purses and
        the time available. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        use of ' O ' rings for packing pistons and glands ensures
        that the very beginner can manufacture efficient pumps.
        In the days of graphited yarn and tallowed hemp, the
        amount of packing and the tightness of gland nuts was
        critical, too little and pressure was lost, too much and
        excessive friction resulted. With careful machining, in
        accordance with the manufacturers instructions, pistons
        and glands will be perfectly tight with the least
        possible amount of friction developing. In the case of
        piston packings some small pieces of tool steel ground to
        the correct width for the main sizes of ' O ' ring will
        save time in preparing the necessary grooves. For gland
        nuts, small diameter boring tools, again ground up to the
        correct profile can be set into the tool holder described
        later to machine the internal grooves in glands. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Pumps
        should be located such that the eccentric rod is as long
        as possible. This reduces the wear on glands as well as
        cutting out a certain amount of the friction in the
        system. The length of the ram is also critical in this
        respect.. In Pixie the pump is mounted behind the front
        beam, below the saddle, on a block profiled such that the
        axis of the pump lines with the centre of the front axle.
        This position was chosen as the available space was
        limited by the position of the main stretcher spanning
        between the motion plates. There would also have been
        insufficient clearance around the back axle for the sweep
        of the eccentric strap. The mounting block is secured to
        the front beam by countersunk screws hidden behind the
        front coupling, the pump in its turn being bolted to the
        block. This arrangement will permit the pump to be
        dropped down from between the frames in the event of
        maintenance being required. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Pump
        rams are best made of rustless steel, barrels are
        generally gunmetal castings incorporating the stand and
        valve box and are readily obtainable from the trade.
        Rustless steel balls, a suitable sized ' O ' ring and
        some hexagon brass bar complete the material
        requirements. Construction details have been spelled out
        many times in the model engineering press and there is
        little point in repeating them here. LBSC gave good
        coverage in his collection entitled ' LBSC's Shop Shed
        and Road ' which describes several types of pump and
        their construction. He notes the key points, for
        efficiency of eccentric driven pumps as being, ' fairly
        large bore and short stroke, ample sized ball valves with
        restricted lift, minimum clearance within the pump
        itself, and the water pipes ( especially the suction ) of
        sufficient diameter not to throttle the flow of water '. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        crosshead driven pump has a lot to offer, not the least
        being accessibility for adjustment and maintenance.
        Discussing the the advantages of a crosshead-driven
        feedwater pump in the case of ' Rob Roy ', Martin Evans
        rightly states that ' such a pump is readily accessible
        for servicing, if the pump doesn' t function for some
        reason such as balls sticking or becoming furred-up, it
        is only the work of minutes to take the whole thing off,
        strip it right down and clean the valves etc.' </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">GAUGES
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There
        have been some magical articles in the model press,
        written by wizards who have made their own gauges
        complete with microscopic Bourdon tubes. The beginner
        will do well to buy-in his gauges from a specialist
        supplier. Gauges are not the thing to cut ones teeth on,
        particularly when dealing with the substantial pressures
        that our locomotives are capable of producing. Those who
        have an overwhelming desire to construct their own gauges
        should study the article in Model Engineer. This will
        probably prove sufficient to prompt them to start out for
        the nearest trade supplier of the finished article! The
        gauges on Pixie were purchased from a suppliers
        catalogue, one for the boiler pressure, taking its feed
        from the steam fountain, the other measuring valve chest
        pressure. The latter is fed from the right hand valve
        chest via a ' tee ' incorporating a drain valve complete
        with a tap reminiscent of that to be found on a antique
        Samovar, complete with ebony handle, replicated here by a
        turned, stained and varnished piece of hardwood on a mild
        steel spindle. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SANDING
        GEAR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Sandboxes
        are a prominent feature on most narrow gauge locomotives,
        being especially necessary in the conditions in which
        narrow gauge locomotives operate. Making the sandboxes on
        any narrow gauge locomotive should give the builder great
        deal of enjoyment. Whether mounted on the running plates,
        on top the boiler or as in the case of the Wrenn Class on
        the front of the saddle tank, they probably include a
        degree of geometry. The many patterns can be produced by
        turning or using a combination of turned parts and barrel
        or formed sheet. Sandboxes are another of the features
        which generate atmosphere and care was taken to replicate
        those on the model. For Pixie the mild steel fronts and
        backs of the boxes were flanged up over a piece of 1/4
        inch plate which was cut to the correct profile, with
        allowance for the plate thickness to be used, and rounded
        on one edge. As the flange was to be relatively narrow
        flanging could be done cold without too much upset to the
        metal. With the profiled plate sandwiched between the
        template and a slightly smaller piece of stock steel it
        was gradually flanged using hammer with a smooth face.
        Progressing around the plate about 1/8 inch of flange was
        formed without creases. After removal from the templates
        the flanges were brought to uniform thickness by filing,
        paired off and marked in two sets. With the plates set
        flange to flange, the outside edges were trued locally,
        again by filing. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        wire was bent around the perimeter of the flange to
        establish the length of the strips of mild steel infill
        which were to form the sides, top and bottom of the
        boxes. The strips were then bent to the required profile
        and small adjustments made to ensure a neat butt joint.
        At this stage a small hole was drilled centrally where
        the flange for the cover would be located. This was
        thought necessary to avoid any possibility of an
        explosion as each box was sealed during welding! Now the
        three pieces of each box were wired together and the
        welding operation carried out. Welding was only adopted
        for this assembly as access was available to TIG welding
        equipment, brazing would have been equally acceptable.
        After the assemblies had been cleaned-up the filler
        openings were drilled and bored and flanges for the
        covers were soldered into place. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the boxes clamped to the topslide of the lathe the holes
        for bushes for the operating rod could be drilled. As the
        rod passes through four bushes, two in each box, the
        lathe set-up was used in order to ensure that the holes
        lined correctly, parallel to the faces of the boxes. The
        bushes for the operating rod were then soldered into
        place, location aided by turned shoulders, bearing
        against the sandbox sides and the insertion of a length
        of rod which had been thoroughly oxidised to prevent it
        becoming a permanent installation! Now the back of each
        box was drilled for the fixing bolts which were to engage
        in the blind, stepped bushes in the front face of the
        saddle tank. These holes were spotted from the template
        prepared at the time when the bushes were set-out on the
        tank. The cone shaped feeders at the bottom of the boxes
        were shaped and fly cut to radius then through-drilled
        for the sand flow. Pipe flanges were prepared and drilled
        at the same time as the feeder cones to ensure a good fit
        on final assembly. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Filler
        caps and flanges proved to be simple turning jobs and one
        of those little tasks that give so much enjoyment in
        obtaining the correct curves. These are achieved using a
        graver held on a bar secured under the clamping shoe of
        the top slide, and finished, dare I say, by filing in the
        lathe! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        operating lever with a boss at one end and at the other a
        tapped hole providing a fixing for the pivot bolt
        connection with the pull rod was prepared from mild
        steel. The pull rod itself is a length of 1 / 8 inch
        diameter mild steel rod terminating in an eye for the
        pivot bolt at one end and yet another ' Victorian
        cupboard handle ' at the other. The travel of this pull
        rod is limited by a strategically placed split pin which
        bears against the weather plate in the extreme rearward
        position. Small cranks and a dart valve inside each box
        control the flow of sand to the copper sandpipes which
        extend to the track level and are supported at one spot
        by pipe brackets bolted to the main frame members. </font></p>

        water on Pixie is introduces via clack valves positioned
        where the prototype injectors are installed. Clacks are
        efficient and provide trouble free running. Lately time
        has permitted the production of dummy injectors which fit
        into the bosses on the boiler and replicate injectors for
        show purposes. These dummy injectors, whilst outwardly
        similar to the prototype, are in reality clack valves in
        disguise. they are soldered up assemblies of pieces filed
        from gunmetal offcuts from other operations. The screwed
        cap permits the installation of a spring and ball valve
        just as in standard valve. At a later date a working
        injector will be installed under the footplate. </font></p>

        by-pass valve. On Pixie this is mounted on the left hand
        frame member in the space between the back of the bunker
        and the boiler cleading. It is unobtrusive in this
        position, yet easily accessible. The valve itself is an
        essential brought about by the axle mounted water pump
        and the setting has to be monitored in steam to prevent
        over-feed and priming. That is if the driver wishes to
        avoid the ' hot shower ' which will otherwise result! </font></p>

        feed goes to the boiler, that from the axle pump via the
        by-pass valve. Sited below the front of the saddle tank
        is a balance pipe which also serves for emptying the

        of gunmetal, chucking pieces from a previous model, these
        were to form the body and gland. The machining involved
        is similar to that for any gland assembly, the body being
        a slide fit in the large bush on the backhead, secured in
        place using threaded and shouldered studs. Nuts on the
        threaded part of the stud tighten the gland into its
        recess. An ' O' ring was installed into a groove behind
        the flange of the regulator body so as to bear on the
        boiler bush and ensure a steam tight joint. ' O ' Rings,
        whether standard or purpose-made from a kit feature more

        number of reasons prompted the choice of a Stroudley type
        regulator, not the least was the straightforward
        construction and positive action. A further factor was
        that access for maintenance could be simply achieved via.
        the steam dome. These considerations have been bourn out
        in service although the fixing method would be revised in
        a further model. Being reluctant to drill the boiler to
        provide a fixing for the regulator the fastening is is
        made through the steam dome, using stainless steel bolts.
        This necessitates some juggling at the time of assembly
        and would, in a rebuild, be modified to the more
        conventional fixing using a strap screwed to the boiler
        shell. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Gunmetal
        was used for the body of the regulator, and the two valve
        discs. The body was drilled to provide the vertical
        steamway then sealed with screwed plugs. The fixed disc
        and two fixing brackets were silver soldered onto the
        body at one heating. The steamway was drilled through the
        disc and the hole for pivot stud drilled and tapped. Care
        was taken to remove the burrs formed in these drilling
        operations as they would otherwise prevent the valve disc
        from making a steam tight joint with the fixed disc. A '
        vee ' notch was filed in the edge of the hole in the
        fixed disc to assist in providing gradual opening of the
        port as the regulator was opened in service. The hole for
        the steam pipe was next drilled and tapped. The loose
        disc was then prepared, being drilled a close clearance
        on the pivot pin. Holes were drilled and tapped for the
        linkage bolts. These were threaded such that when fully
        inserted into the holes in the loose disc they provided '
        pinch-free fit ' when passed through the holes in the
        actuating rods. All screws and pins are stainless steel
        and all are drilled and secured using stainless wire to
        prevent loosening in service. The spring maintaining
        contact between the valve faces is of stainless wire
        wound-up around a pin in the 3 jaw, only a light spring
        is required here as steam pressure does the job in
        service. The actuating levers are from rustless steel as
        is the rocker bar. This fits onto a square formed on the
        end of the regulator rod, being retained by a nut
        threaded onto the rod. The rod terminates in the rounded
        spigot which engages in the regulator body. </font></p>

        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        chimney was turned from a piece of reinforcing steel
        culled from the scrap heap on a building site. It was set
        in the 3 jaw, drilled using the largest available drill
        bit, then bored out. The boring tool used was an
        adaptation of a design published in MODEL ENGINEER many
        years ago and described later in this book. This has the
        advantage that it can be entered into small bores and,
        when modest cuts are taken, provides a a long reach
        without chatter. The tool uses small diameter cutters
        which can be produced from the remains of broken centre
        bitts. As with all long tools however it is essential
        that a number of fine finishing cuts are made to
        counteract inaccuracy resulting from the spring of the
        shank holding the tool. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        outer taper was turned in several stages, setting the top
        slide to the required angle and moving the saddle and
        locking it at each intermediate position. A small rebate
        was formed at the top of the piece to locate the cap,
        and, prior to parting-off to finished length, a similar
        rebate formed to seat into the chimney base. The cap and
        base castings were next machined to the required profile
        with the necessary rebate and projection to ensure a good
        register between the parts at the time of soldering the
        joints. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        chimney cap was turned from a piece of gunmetal, set in
        the 3 jaw. It was bored and the joggle formed for the
        joint with the chimney body. The curved surfaces were
        shaped offhand, using a tool supported by a piece of
        stock bar set in the tool post. Once bored and profiled
        the cap was then parted off. The bottom casting was
        turned, again with a joggle for locating the chimney body
        and the plain portion above the flair turned circular.
        The part was then set on the vertical slide for
        fly-cutting to match the radius of the smokebox. This was
        facilitated by using a washer and one of the medium
        Myford tee bolts set into the slot in the vertical slide.
        as in all such operations the slide was packed from the
        topslide to eliminate movement and avoid chatter. Finally
        the flair was ground and filed to shaped. Enthusiasts may
        wish to produce their parts by spinning or raising them
        from gilding metal. This is, it seems, an aquired art and
        presents a rather daunting prospect to the tyro. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        three parts were joined by silver soldering and the base
        drilled for the bolts to fix it in position onto the
        smokebox. As is the case when soldering boiler tubes,
        several small nicks in the joining surfaces will assist
        the flow of solder into the joint. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        petticoat pipe was spun-up from a piece of copper pipe,
        an offcut from the last plumbing job carried out in the
        house. Frequent annealing permitted the lower end to be
        expanded to a profile in line with the recommendations in
        'The manual of Model Locomotive Construction' by Martin
        Evans. The upper end is a push-fit into the chimney and
        stays secure with the aid of a dab of instant gasket.
        Whilst on the face of things this may seem to be a pretty
        tenuous means of fitting it permits the petticoat pipe to
        be withdrawn when access is required to the otherwise
        congested smokebox. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">STEAM
        DOME </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        steam dome on any locomotive is a joy to produce. Whether
        turned from a casting, from solid material or spun to
        shape by the more adventurous and proficient model
        engineer the dome has to be a thing of beauty. The
        fortunate model engineer may find a suitable casting in
        the stocks of his local supplier. He may through perusing
        the details in articles in the model press find a dome
        casting that nearly matches his requirements and can be
        doctored to provide the required form. It was Henry Moore
        the celebrated sculptor who pointed to a massive piece of
        material and said that the form he wanted was ' in there
        somewhere' ! The dome on PIXIE has been fabricated from
        thin sheet metal and fortunately there is a joint in the
        material just below the convex curve at the top. In the
        case of Pixie this permits a turned dome being produced
        in two pieces, the lower from an offcut of steel of
        unknown parentage, probably a cropping from a stockists
        scrapbox, the upper a cast piece of gunmetal. Assembly
        from two pieces of material also facilitated the cutting
        of the opening for the base of the safety valve assembly.
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        length of bar for the lower dome was cut by hand from the
        billet of steel.... blood and sweat ! The length required
        was determined bearing in mind the flare which fits over
        the cleading. This was then set in the 3 jaw chuck and a
        length slightly less than the dimension from the top of
        the flair to the top of the parallel portion of the dome
        was turned to finished diameter. A small rebate was
        formed in the end to provide a location for the dome top
        section. The blank was then turned in the chuck, gripped
        by the reduced section and the remainder turned to to the
        diameter of the finished flair. The body was then bored
        out to clear the inner dome. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst
        means of producing the flair by milling alone have been
        described by Martin Evans, the tyro will find that the
        simplest solution to the somewhat knotty problem of the
        geometry involved will be to turn the upper, external
        concave shape which is viewed in the side elevation of
        the finished dome, fly cut the seating to match the
        boiler cleading ( NOT the boiler itself ) then mill away
        the evidently surplus material before finally finishing
        up with a succession of files. Ideally the edges of the
        flare should be very thin to replicate the prototype,
        this is easier said than done and the individual must
        work to HIS predetermined standard. Again a template will
        assist in achieving the correct profile. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Following
        the sequence described above, the base of the dome was
        fly-cut to the profile of the cleading. The part-machined
        blank was mounted on the vertical slide using bolts
        passed into the tee grooves via a washer fitted into the
        inner dome recess. In instances such as this where
        material is to be machined whilst attached to the
        vertical slide, particularly where there is any amount of
        overhang, some packing should be used to augment the
        support provided by the bolts or clamps. A piece of stock
        bar and some small blocks secured between the piece to be
        machined and the top slide will provide such support This
        precaution will be appreciated when for example the
        heavier of the intermittent cuts of a fly cutter are
        experienced. Once again, a reminder .... when fly
        cutting, first set the cutter to describe a radius
        greater than the required finished radius and then slowly
        reduce the radius of the cut, whilst advancing the piece,
        until the eventual diameter is achieved. Frequent
        checking against a template will ensure a good fit. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the seating shape generated, the excess material was
        milled away and the final form achieved by filing, taking
        care not to remove too much material in any one place at
        a time. The filing operations were eased by mounting the
        dome blank onto a mandrel secured in the vice at the
        workbench. Final polishing produced an acceptable lower
        dome ready for drilling for the various valves which
        adorn the prototype. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Pixie's
        upper dome was produced by straightforward turning,
        finished freehand using a tool bearing upon a length of
        stock bar set in the toolpost. The part was then set,
        protected by paper at each jaw in the 3 jaw for the inner
        profile and the locating tongue to be turned. Later the
        plan profile of the the safety valve base was set out on
        the top of this piece using lines scribed in marking blue
        and the opening milled for final filing to fit at the
        time of erection. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SAFETY
        VALVES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        safety valves on PIXIE sit on top of the steam dome. This
        arrangement is replicated in Pixie by two valve bodies,
        containing the valve seatings, which pass through a
        shaped block into bushes in the top of the inner steam
        dome. A turned pillar which provides the fulcrum for the
        spring retaining beam is mounted on the block. When the
        valves lift, exhausting steam is directed away above the
        roof of the locomotive by two polished brass pipes
        slotted to fit over the retaining beam. These pipes seat
        upon a shoulder turned onto the valve seat bushes and are
        supported by a mild steel bracket bolted to the roof. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Where
        two safety valves are fitted, and this is recommended,
        they should be set to blow at the same pressure. Failing
        this the higher of the two may never be actuated and may
        seize-up. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        Pixie the valves are phosphor bronze balls drilled and
        tapped to accept stainless steel spindles. The seat for
        the balls was formed in the manner described by LBSC, a
        blow with a heavy hammer on a steel ball set onto the
        embryo seating. To avoid thread damage during this
        somewhat brutal procedure each valve bush in turn was
        screwed, as far as its shoulder, into a tapped hole in a
        substantial piece of bar. Valve springs were wound from
        stainless steel wire and were tested using a simple
        loading rig as described in an article by ' Laurie '
        Lawrence on ' SAFETY VALVES AND A FEW OTHER SAFE ODDS AND
        ENDS ' in Model engineer Vol. 162 No.3847 of May 1989 </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">RETRO-FITTED
        PUMP ECCENTRIC </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        axle driven pump is, of course, quite unprototypical in
        the case of Pixie, although as with most things connected
        with locomotion, there are prototypical examples of the
        use of axle pumps. However, in view of often encountered
        comments regarding substandard performance of injectors
        with ' warm ' water an axle driven pump is mounted behind
        the front plate. Later experiments may result in this
        being discarded in favour of an injector. With subsequent
        removal of the pump in mind, and as the wheels are bonded
        onto the axles, the pump eccentric is clamped and pinned
        to the leading axle. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        standard pump is mounted on a pair of tapered blocks
        behind the front plate using countersunk headed screws.
        The inclination of the blocks lines the pump with the
        axle. A blank for the eccentric tumbler was first
        produced from a piece of stock bar, this was left
        oversize for eventual finish turning and the machining of
        the locating groove for the eccentric sheave. A length of
        bar of sufficient section to incorporate the clamping
        bolts was squared-up on all four faces. This block was
        drilled for clamping bolts. One of the faces was 'raised'
        by centre pop marks to ensure full penetration of the
        solder into the joint, and the block then silver soldered
        into position on the tumbler disc with regard to the
        approximate axle centreline. The assembly was then split
        by sawing, the sawn faces lightly cleaned up and the
        whole re-assembled to enable the axle hole to be drilled
        then bored. With the hole bored a thou or so undersize,
        the assembly could now be clamped onto a stub of material
        of the same diameter as the axle, mounted in the four
        jaw, offset by the throw of the eccentric. Now the
        eccentric was machined to final shape including the
        projecting guide. Later, during erection, the eccentric
        assembly was pinned to the axle using a short length of
        silver steel, this was inserted into a hole drilled
        through the clamping block. The eccentric thus produced
        works efficiently and can be removed when an injector is
        fitted in due course. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        eccentric strap was a standard casting intended for
        another locomotive. The lugs were drilled for the
        assembly bolts, the assembly sawn into two parts,
        re-assembled then faced and the inner radius and guide
        groove bored, to match the tumbler which was frequently
        offered up to ensure a nice fit. The strap was then
        clamped onto a stub of stock material for the other face
        to be machined. Provision of an oil cap on one lug and
        milling the halved joint for the eccentric rod completed
        the part. Binding between the tumbler and the completed
        strap was eased by some judicious application of grinding
        paste then metal polish followed by a good wash and scrub
        with scouring powder and detergent ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">LBSC's
        words and music provided the basis of the method used to
        produce the drain cocks. The principle operation here was
        not that of machining the valve bodies but rather the
        manufacture of a tapered reamer for forming the valve
        seatings. The technique involved setting the top slide to
        the correct inclination and turning not only the tapered
        plugs but also a reamer in silver steel for forming the
        seating within the body of the valve. The reamer was then
        filed to shape and tempered. The cross hole in the body
        of the valve was drilled undersize and then reamed to
        what must then to be the correct taper for the plug. The
        ' thin ' end of the plug was then threaded for the
        retaining nut and washer and the ' thick ' end squared-up
        for the attachment of the operating lever. A little '
        running-in ' with a small amount of grinding paste
        ensured a tight valve although all traces of the paste
        had to be removed using scouring powder then detergent.
        On Pixie very small diameter tubes are superglued into
        the valve outlets to direct the wet steam away from the
        loco with the drain cocks in the open position. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">STEAM
        ACTUATED CYLINDER DRAIN VALVES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When
        first encountered PIXIE was fitted with steam actuated
        drain cocks. These are operated from the footplate by a
        valve similar to that found on the outlet of Victorian
        tea urns, a valve of character ! The actuating cylinder
        is mounted behind the front beam, the piston rod
        connecting to the cockshaft via a link and lever. The bar
        connecting the drain cocks on the right hand side of the
        locomotive has a tension spring which keeps the cocks
        open / closed according to the setting of the valve on
        the weather plate. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        short stub of gunmetal was turned then bored for the
        cylinder, quite fun as it is only just about an inch
        overall. A cylinder cover was turned to suit and bored
        for the piston rod. The piston and rod were prepared all
        as those for the engines, and the whole assembled using 8
        BA bolts. The cylinder is mounted behind the front beam
        on an angle bracket, forked around the steam inlet union,
        again using small bolts. The crank, pivot and lever
        connecting to the cock provided some watchmaking
        experience, the lever being pinned to the cockshaft which
        is set in tiny bearing bosses on the frames. </font></p>

        inch thick, generated the curves of the platework which
        in this mock-up was represented by thick cardboard. One
        of the plywood dummy ends was later used as a template
        when cutting a piece of 3 / 8 inch mild steel plate to be
        used as a flanging plate. Provision of the mock-up
        enabled an early trial fit to be made to confirm that the

        established for the location of angle brackets which
        would eventually be brazed to the boiler shell. The
        position of the curved steel angle support connecting the
        tank to the smokebox could likewise be established.
        Messrs, Reeves asbestos-free lagging material was to be
        used in conjunction with cleading and boiler bands of
        brass sheet. The mock up confirmed that there was
        sufficient space between the underside of the tank and
        the boiler for these items. With key dimensions of the
        model components established, work could be commenced on
        the tank proper. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FLANGING
        THE PLATES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        was decided to use mild steel plate for the tank rather
        than brass sheet which would have been the alternative.
        By making a few trial sections of flanges which included
        both convex and concave curves it was established that,
        with care, 16 gauge mild steel could be flanged cold
        without loss of flatness of the plane parts of the
        platework. This could be achieved provided that, whilst
        flanging, the plate was sandwiched between the 3 / 8 inch
        template and a stiff piece of plate slightly smaller than
        the flat part of the template. As the flanges were formed
        it became necessary to snip out excess material from the
        flange at the convex corners in order to avoid cockling
        and to provide a smooth land for the wrapper plate. A
        touch of weld-metal sealed the flange at these points.
        With care the metal could be spread sufficiently to
        accomodate the concave curves where the tank sits over
        the smokebox and boiler cleading. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        the prototype, due to the riveted construction and the
        lapping of plates, it was necessary to form a joggle in
        the flanges to accommodate the extra layer of plate at
        the lap joint adjacent to the bottom corner of each side.
        This was also necessary in the model, It was achieved by
        setting the plate into the twin vices , and using two
        substantial backing bars together with two offcut pieces
        of plate of thickness equivalent to that of the tank
        plating. With the offcut pieces of plate positioned
        either side of the tank plate, above and below the
        position of the joggle, the vices were tightened in
        unison and the offset or joggle in the tank plate thus
        formed as it would be in a press. A considerable amount
        of ' presswork ' can be carried out in the vice although
        of course the bigger the vice, the better for such
        applications. When folding or pressing, the workpiece
        should always be supported using quite heavy backing
        bars, in this way twist and distortion will be avoided. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SANDBOX
        FIXINGS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        this stage fixings for the sandboxes were inserted into
        the front flanged plate. these consisted of brass bushes
        of 'top-hat' configuration in which were blind holes
        tapped to receive bolts which would be passed through the
        back of the sandbox. These bushes, as well as providing a
        secure fixing for the sandboxes served to space the
        sandbox from the front plate. The holes for the fixing
        sockets were drilled to template, the template then set
        aside for future use in drilling corresponding holes in
        the sand boxes, a small note was scribed on the templates
        as a ' reminder ' to reverse the templates when applied
        to the back of the boxes ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WRAPPER
        PLATES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        tank wrapper plates were formed using suitably sized bars
        from stock set in the twin vices at the dirty bench.
        Packings sitting on the bed of the vice located two bars,
        one the radiussed bar which actually formed the bend, the
        other a square section bar to maintain the flatness of
        the plate. Timber drifts used driven by a builders ' lump
        ' hammer persuaded the plate to take up the right form.
        The certain way to generate blemishes in folded
        platework, when not using a folding tool, is to use too
        light a hammer when bending or flanging. Blemishes are
        also formed if the face or edge of a hammer is allowed to
        come into contact with the plate. It is essential that
        clean barstock, free from blemishes is used for the
        formers, otherwise blemishes will be transferred into the
        plate being folded. A hardwood block should always be
        interposed between the plate and the hammer as the metal
        plate is bent. The combination of hammer blows and
        pressure applied to the plate by the free hand ensures
        the desired curve being generated. With some steels,
        particularly stainless steel, it will be necessary to
        over-bend the plate slightly to allow for elastic
        recovery although care is needed to avoid forming a local
        kink beyond the freshly formed curve. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Difficulty
        can be experienced in correctly gauging the width of
        plates which are to be folded to fit into, or around,
        concave or convex flanges. It it is advisable to start
        with an overwide piece of plate which can be trimmed to
        size on completion of the folding operation. The
        approximate width of such plates can be established by
        bending a piece of fairly stiff wire around the flanged
        plate, straightening it, then making some small allowance
        for the effects of the bends to establish the cutting
        width. With the folding operation completed any excess
        can be cut away. In the course of forming wrapper plates
        frequent checking against the flanged plates is necessary
        to ensure a good fit. It is important to make index marks
        on the flanged plates and wrapper to ensure that the
        wrapper is located in the same place each time a trial
        fit is made. Temporary marks of this nature are best made
        with a ' Permanent ' grade of pen as used for overhead
        projectors. The marks can be removed using methylated
        spirits and a scrap of rag. Trial fits should be made
        against each end plate as, when using rolls, particularly
        when using makeshift ' bending rolls ' lacking control of
        parallelity, there may be some small difference between
        the two ends of the wrapper plates. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TANK
        ASSEMBLY </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        tank currently mounted on PIXIE has been fabricated by
        welding, with dummy rivets, a grand job it is too!
        However, as locomotive was to be modelled as it was the
        first time it coasted into Pages Park Station on the
        Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. It had to be a
        fully riveted assembly on Pixie! In order that the
        rivetting process could be carried out on all visible
        joints it was decided that a closing plate would be
        introduced into the curved underside of the tank. When
        all had been riveted up this plate was to be inserted and
        secured by countersunk screws into tapped holes in butt
        straps along the joint. Being on the underside of the
        tank these would not be visible in the finished model. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Rivetting
        was carried out commencing with the installation of the
        tank front. Fortunately, in the prototype the flange on
        the backplate of the tank is located rearward-looking and
        these rivets can be inserted and formed last. Soft iron
        rivets were used, a dolly being set in the vice to enable
        the innermost rivets to be reached. As with all riveted
        joints it is essential that the plates being joined are
        held tightly together to avoid the rivet shanks
        distorting and actually spacing the plates apart. Rivet
        holes should be marked by a scribed line and set out
        along the line using dividers. Apart from satisfying the
        ' rivet counting brigade ', accuracy of line and spacing
        have a considerable effect on the appearance of the
        finished model, and any inaccuracy on the tanks or
        bunkers which form a prominent feature of many narrow
        gauge locomotives can detract from otherwise good quality
        workmanship. Once the holes in the wrapper are drilled
        the flanged plate can be set into position and two holes
        transfer-drilled from the wrapper. Two small bolts
        through these holes will then hold the plates in the
        correct location whilst the remainder of the drilling is
        carried out. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        reconstructed tank on the prototype has an access panel
        let into the tank top. In the model advantage was taken
        of this feature to enable access for lining the tank with
        Fiberglass for durability purposes. When laying up the
        fibreglass in the tank BONDAGLASS pre-wetted glassfibre
        tape was used to ensure a good fit into the corners
        Pre-wetting avoids a problem well known to laminators,
        that of air becoming trapped between the composite lining
        and the base material at angles. Entrapped air makes it
        difficult to fully ' wet out ' the glassfibre. At this
        stage a baffle was glassed into position across the tank
        below the filler opening to prevent water in the tank
        surging backwards and forwards when the model is started
        and stopped in service. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FILLER
        CAP AND PIPE FLANGES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        tank filler cap flange was turned from gunmetal as was
        the cover. The cover was made a push-fit on the flange to
        avoid problems in service. These activities are great
        fun, especially the reproduction of detail such as the
        very domesticated knob on the filler cap ! After fixing
        the filler cap flange by rivetting the underside of the
        panel was primed and painted. The panel was then secured
        by screws into flanges fixed to the underside of the tank
        top. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Balance
        pipe and feed pipe connection flanges were fixed into
        position on the wrapper using countersunk screws into
        tapped holes, a seal being achieved using Araldite. Once
        the Araldite had cured, the holes in the flanges guided
        the drills used to penetrate the tank . Where a mating
        flange is required, for the feed pipes for example, good
        matching fits can be achieved if these items are prepared
        at the same time as those for the tank. Pairs of flanges
        drilled and, if necessary, tapped at the same time ensure
        an accurate fit when they are eventually fixed together
        when the plumbing is installed. Flanges pre-prepared in
        this fashion should be marked according to location ( and
        orientation ) and stored safely for later use. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TANK
        MOUNTINGS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        tank is located and fixed at the smokebox using a
        radiussed steel angle, connection being made by bolts
        passing through the tank front and through the top of the
        smokebox. Attempts to form this by heating a piece of
        angle then bending it around a former failed, due to
        distortion of the section. This problem was solved by
        producing a simple plaster pattern from which a local
        foundry produce a suitable casting. This casting was set
        on the lathe faceplate and turned to finished section and
        radius. The angle is quite prominent on the model and,
        whilst this solution amounted to the ' use of a
        sledge-hammer to crack a nut ', the correctly shaped
        mounting enhances the overall appearance of this part of
        the locomotive. An alternative would have been to
        rough-saw the shape from the solid and then turn it to
        final form. On the model only two bolts are actually used
        in fixing the angle to the tank front, the rest are
        simulated by nuts run onto studs set in the angle.
        Similarly only two bolts actually penetrate the smokebox,
        the remainder being dummies. In the case of this fixing,
        as in many instances encountered in model making,
        absolute replication of fixings and fastenings is
        unnecessary for the purposes of strength and may even
        complicate final assembly and later maintenance. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        rear of the tank is located and retained by studs set
        into mounting plates on the underside of the tank, these
        pass through holes in the brackets on the boiler shell,
        these holes are slotted to cater for movement as the
        boiler heats and cools. The plates on the underside of
        the tank were fixed using countersunk screws into the
        wrapper plate, the joint being anointed with Araldite
        before the mounting was fixed. The fixing studs project
        downwards through hardwood blocks, which exist for
        insulation purposes. Teak blocks are used on the model
        and these allow a small amount of adjustment to overcome
        inaccuracies in the level of the tank assembly measured
        at the time of erection. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Two
        holes were drilled in the upper flanged joint at the rear
        of the tank. These are required for bolts fixing the
        stay-rods to the weather board, or as it might be termed
        on other locomotives, the spectacle plate! These two
        holes are coincident with the pitch of the rivets at this
        point. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PRIMING
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        is most enjoyable to see a model develop in gleaming raw
        metal, be it steel, cast iron or gunmetal, and there is
        always a reluctance to follow what is perhaps the more
        usual sequence of priming, undercoating and painting
        parts as the work of production and erection proceeds. It
        has to be admitted however that there is little worse
        than entering the workshop and finding that surfaces,
        which the previous evening had exhibited a satisfying
        shine, are marred by embryo rusty fingerprints ! It is
        difficult enough to prepare metal around rows of rivets
        for priming, without having to remove such evidence. In
        view of the mild steel construction it was decided to
        prime the finished tank before storage. Accordingly, the
        tank was spray coated with a rust preventative paint, '
        BONDAPRIMER, this is a resin based paint containing zinc
        which has good covering powers and dries quickly to a
        uniform matt finish. This was a drastic step as painting
        a model is not something to be attempted lightly !
        Experience has proved that this was the right course to
        adopt, the primer warded off the dreaded rust and
        provided a hard base for subsequent coatings, although
        they were applied many months later. More about the
        painting process anon! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">COAL
        BUNKERS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        coal bunkers presented another folding job. This time a
        flanging plate was produced to the dimensions of the
        inside of the main face of the bunker. Two suitably sized
        pieces of stainless steel plate were prepared to the
        correct height of the bunker. The plate to be folded was
        sandwiched between the flanging plate and a substantial
        piece of plate from stock, this was cut just slightly
        smaller than the flat on the flanging plate. This '
        sandwich ' was then gripped in the vice and force applied
        via. a hardwood block. Care was taken when applying the
        force to start close to the stock plate to achieve the
        necessary tight bend. To overcome difficulty experienced
        in gripping the small amount of plate projecting from the
        sandwich this was held between two further pieces of
        stock held by a ' mole ' wrench which allowed hand
        pressure to be applied. With the bends completed a check
        was made on a true surface to ensure that the whole
        assembly sat flat and that the back and front were
        perpendicular to the base. Any slight twist in the formed
        plate was adjusted at this stage before the back and
        front edges of each bunker was trimmed to the correct
        length. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        top edge of each bunker is trimmed by a beading. A length
        of 5 / 16 inch diameter rod was milled filed to the
        correct 'D' section ( filing would have sufficed ), bent
        to match the top edge of each bunker and then riveted
        into position. The openings at the bottom of each bunker
        were chain drilled and sawn to shape prior to fitting
        steel angles at the edges which would abut the back
        plates. Similar angle was fixed to the bottom edge of
        each folding and to the back plates for use in fixing the
        bunkers to the footplates. Before rivetting these joints,
        plates were cut to the correct profile to fit into the
        bunkers. It was decided to mount the boiler feedwater
        pump in the left hand bunker and that plate was slotted
        accordingly. The left hand bunker was chosen for the pump
        location as this would free the right hand for the
        ticklish work of stoking through the dimunitive firehole
        door ! Later a hole would need to be drilled for the
        feedwater pipe although at this stage in construction the
        exact position of the hole was not known. As stainless
        steel had been used in constructing the bunkers these
        could be left in their pristine, shiny state until the
        time came for the final paint job . A word here about
        working stainless steel. Many are the broken bitts that
        testify to difficulties encountered in drilling ( not to
        mention tapping! ) stainless steel. The secret appears to
        be that any tool used to fashion stainless must be kept
        cutting at all times it is in contact with the metal.
        Considerable heat is developed the moment the tool rubs
        rather than cuts, and the temper is lost or the tool jams
        with dire results in case of the small drills we use.
        Hundreds of rivet holes in stainless plate have proved
        the wisdom of using an anti-scuff paste as a lubricant.
        This combined with working the tool hard by applying
        plenty of force to the feed avoids tool wear, heating and
        damage </font></p>

        THE WEATHER BOARD / SPECTACLE PLATE </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        platework forming the front of the rather spartan cab
        provides some interesting work in shaping the plate
        itself and fabricating the angle steel supporting frame.
        This is mostly straightforward, fashioning material
        prepared according to measurements from the survey into
        model form. The angle supports presented a problem as far
        as bending the metal without distorting the section. The
        difficulty was ovecome in this instance by cutting a disk
        of plate of the scale thickness of the angle and turning
        from this a complete circle of material of angle section.
        Segments of this section were then cut as required to
        meet the geometry of the support frame. The roof bearer
        was of sufficiently large radius to be bent cold in the
        vice. The curved segments, uprights and the roof bearer
        were clamped to a ply template and silver soldered. After
        this the plate could be clamped into position and the
        whole assembly drilled and bolted up. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THE
        SCALE ROOF AND THE DRIVING ROOF </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Two
        roofs were made, one for exhibition purposes, the other
        for use when the locomotive is working. the latter has an
        opening which permits a good view of the 'works', the
        gauges and access to the firehole door and the regulator.
        Stainless steel plate was used here, with rectangular
        section bar stiffeners riveted at all edges, using the
        right number of rivets ! Correct curvature was achieved
        using blocks of wood, a clean length of scaffold tube and
        foot power. The plate was set upon the blocks cut to the
        correct rise on the chord and the scaffold tube applied '
        rolling pin fashion ' by the sole of the shoe. Heath
        Robinson as this may seem, both roofs fit comfortably
        onto the roof bearer for bolting into position, and both
        roofs are completely interchangeable ! Provision was made
        in each case for the two bolts to which the support plate
        for the two brass columns of the safety valves was to be
        attached. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THE
        SCALE BACK AND THE DRIVING BACK </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As
        with the roofs, two backs were fabricated, one for
        driving purposes and the other for exhibition. The scale
        back or rear spectacle plate ( which, due to in service
        modifications to the locomotive, may not replicate the
        back currently fitted to the prototype ), was built to
        the dimensions achieved from the survey soon after I
        first saw the locomotive. It comprises a framework of
        angles and a curved roof bearer, silver soldered together
        and clad with plate. Holes for the glazing were trepanned
        from the plates whilst they were mounted on the vertical
        slide, absolute care being taken to ensure that the face
        of the slide was set dead square to the lathe axis. This
        was ensured by placing one edge of a steel rule against
        the chuck face and bringing the face of the vertical
        slide tight against the other prior to tightening the
        bolts securing it to the topslide. A suitably shaped tool
        was ground-up for the fly cutting tool holder providing
        the nearest radius to the required opening. Bearing in
        mind the maxim that the tool must be kept cutting at all
        times the saddle was fed towards the cutter, propelled by
        the tail stock quill. In such an operation it is
        advisable to tighten the saddle locking bolt slightly,
        and essential to interpose a piece of hard plywood
        between the metal being worked and the topslide. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        glazing is secured within the platework of the scale back
        by two turned rings, one pair cut from brass bar and the
        other from steel. These are of course of such size that
        when fixed, using small screws, they provide a rebate
        into which perspex glazing material can be fitted. The
        driving back is a simple open structure, again silver
        soldered with just side plating added to aid with
        rigidity along the main axis of the locomotive. A small
        angle provides a fixing for the brake standard </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">.
        FOOTPLATES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        PIXIE the footplates are quite rudimentary. There is a
        plate which bears on angle steel brackets attached to the
        inside of the frames and two outer plates which are
        supported on brackets on the drag beam and cantilever
        brackets riveted to the outside of the frames below the
        bunkers. Stainless steel plate is used on the model, more
        drilling ! Angle steel stiffeners run around below the
        edge of the outer plates. The rather tight bend below the
        front of the bunkers can be formed by cutting a 90 degree
        ' vee ' from the flange and bending the material cold.
        Care is required here to ensure that bolting faces of the
        angle remain flat, this can be checked on a true surface
        as the bend is formed. The cantilever support brackets
        may be cut from angle steel or fabricated, I chose the
        latter course, adding the smaller angle for the footplate
        connection as on the prototype. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        plate between the frames has an opening for the damper
        lever and a small cranked plate that engages with this
        lever to locate the damper in the required position. It
        is advisable to leave the cranking process until the
        correct angle can be be gauged to the slots in the lever.
        Small checkouts will be required in each of the
        footplates to accomodate the angle brackets at the
        junction between the drag beam and the main frame
        members. In the central plate the drain pipe from the
        water gauge and fixings for the brake standard have also
        to be accommodated. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        ashpan and damper are important parts of the firing
        system. In Pixie they are constructed of stainless steel
        sheet and mild steel angle. The angles sit below the
        foundation ring of the boiler, located by stainless steel
        dowels set into tapped holes in the ring. The upper edge
        of the ashpan projects slightly into the firebox and thus
        provides support for the grate which is cut from a
        section of proprietary stainless steel grate material
        supplied by Messrs Spinks. A length of mild steel was
        milled, drilled and filed to shape and cut into four
        pieces to provide the hinge blocks into which a stainless
        steel hingepin is slipped. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        damper is controlled by a lever projecting through the
        central footplate and retained by a small, joggled piece
        of plate. Any of three checkouts in the lever locate on
        this to provide three settings, one fully closed and two
        sizes of opening...high tech ! In service the position of
        the damper does make quite a difference to the state of
        the fire, closed down it allows the engine to simmer
        comfortably. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        SMALL PREVIEW ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        this stage a 'mini-erection' can be carried out ! The
        cantilever brackets supporting the outer footplates can
        be installed and the outer footplates set into position
        and bolted into place. Next the bunkers can be positioned
        and the fixing holes drilled through from the fixing
        angles. Then the weather board and the backplate can be
        set up. The weather board bolts to the bunker front and
        the back to the drag beam. Now the roof can be installed
        and it is time to step back and admire the fruits of our
        labours so far! </font></p>

        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As
        this chapter proceeds the text describes the work in
        erection. Although this book is not of the ' words and
        music ' type produced by illustrious writers such as
        LBSC, Martin Evans, Keith Wilson and other extremely
        experienced model designers and builders, it is written
        with an understanding of the problems that face the
        newcomer. It is hoped that the approach adopted will
        assist newcomers to model locomotives in their efforts. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst
        the reader may be building a model of another prototype
        the principle procedures stand. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">ERECTION
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This
        is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the construction
        process, when at last the fruits of one's labours take
        finished form. The work of erection will be eased if the
        builder has access to both sides of the locomotive. Many
        builders employ an erection frame at this point in
        construction and there have been a number of examples in
        the various model publications. If the modeller intends
        to go along that route it is worthwhile making a frame
        that can be adjusted for use in subsequent maintenance
        operations, and indeed for further locomotive erection.
        End frames set upon an angle steel base can provide
        adjustment for length of locomotive, the ends being slid
        along the angles and clamped into position as required. A
        frame that permits the locomotive to be rotated and
        locked in any position is obviously going to be an asset
        although provided that the end frames are of square form
        and large enough to clear the projecting part of the
        locomotive this will permit access to the locomotive
        whilst the frame is set on its side or inverted. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Mr
        J Bowman described a useful building stand in MODEL
        ENGINEER Vol 159 No 3805, August 1987, this was built
        using two scrap car jacks obtained from a breakers yard.
        Pivoted clamps provided attachment to the front and back
        beams of the locomotive. The jacking screw arrangement
        can be used to elevate the model to the required working
        height, as the designer says, opening-up useful bench
        space beneath the model. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FRAMES
        AND MOTION </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the frames inverted the axle sets are be dropped into
        position, including any springs or rubber parts of the
        suspension. The hornplates are installed, their bolts
        being anointed with a spot of fixing fluid. At this stage
        it is convenient to install an axle pump if one is to be
        fitted, the bolts connecting the parts of the eccentric
        strap again being given a touch of securing fluid. The
        cylinder blocks can be attached to the frames,
        remembering to insert insulation between the back of the
        block and the frame, where required. The motion plates
        are next, the bolts, or dummy rivets in the case of Pixie
        being inserted and taken up tight. The slide bars can
        then be installed between the seatings on the piston rod
        glands and the lug on the motion plate, not forgetting to
        install the crossheads, the correct way round. At this
        stage the geometry of the engines should be checked out.
        Careful measurement of the distances between the piston
        rod and the slide bar ( s ) at the extreme ends revealing
        whether the two are parallel. This adjustment is carried
        out on a full size locomotive by sighting through the
        centre-line of the cylinder or establishing the centre
        line using a taut wire then taking measurements in the
        same fashion. Any minor adjustments can be made by
        insertion of shim washers where the slide bars are
        attached to the motion plates. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        this stage the cock shaft for the cylinder drain valves
        can be installed, as can the small steam actuating
        cylinder and cranks. The cylinder bolts behind the front
        plate on the right hand side of the locomotive. The
        straps linking the cocks can be installed. that on the
        right hand side of the locomotive having an extension for
        a return spring which is secured to an eye bolt through a
        plate projecting from below the front beam. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Coupling
        rods, with marine bearings in the case of Pixie, are
        next. Some anti-scuff paste assists in sliding them home
        onto the crankpins. In the case of crankpins constructed
        incorporating the retaining flange, scale marine bearings
        can be split on the centreline of the crankpin and
        bolted-up. With dummy marine bearings, the leading end of
        the coupling rod can be secured by a countersunk cap
        sized to replicate the head of the crankpin. A nice
        detail in Martin Evans book ' Model steam locomotive
        construction ' shows the use of either a cap threaded
        onto the crankpin, or the use of a cap secured by an ' 0
        ' BA Allen screw. Whichever is chosen, securing fluid
        ensures that the caps do not come loose in service. In
        the marine bearing the upper bolt must be that having the
        groove for lubricant. Each bolt has a full nut, half nut
        as a locknut and a split cotter pin for safety. With the
        rear coupling rod bearing assembly completed, the
        crossheads can be installed on the slide bars, including
        slipper plates as appropriate, and the piston rod /
        crosshead joint made using a cotter or bolts. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        connecting rods can be positioned and gudgeon pins
        installed. On Pixie it is possible to drop the connecting
        rod by rotating the wheels to a position where the
        crosshead clears the wheel allowing the the gudgeon pin
        to be withdrawn from the back of the crosshead, this is
        helpful when it comes to routine maintenance. The gudgeon
        pins have single large nuts on the threaded portion,
        again safety split cotterpins are inserted. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the coupling rods installed, connecting rods secured
        within the crossheads and the cylinder drain cocks open
        and plenty of machine oil on all the moving parts the
        motion should turn over sweetly. In the event of any
        binding the bearings can be slackened one by one to find
        the offender when a touch with a fine file or insertion
        of a piece of shim stock sorts the problem . </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WEIGHSHAFT
        AND VALVE GEAR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        weighshaft brackets on PIXIE are fixed by bolts through
        the stiffening angles on the main frame and through the
        frames themselves. In the case of Hackworth valve gear
        the position of the centre of the weighshaft relative to
        the remainder of the motion is critical to the valve
        events and these have to be checked out prior to finally
        fixing the position of the weighshaft brackets. A check
        was made prior to constructing the valve gear by making a
        twice scale sized model in card, set up on the drawing
        board. The location of the brackets on Pixie is exactly
        as established from the survey and fortunately the
        positions and sizes of components thus determined
        provided, in conjunction with scale sized components,
        sufficient valve travel. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        return is crank set on the rear crankpin, lined with the
        axle centre and both the bolts tightened. A spot of
        securing liquid assists in maintaining the correct
        position although with a well fitted, reamed hole in the
        return crank the locking bolts provide a remarkably
        strong connection. A variety of methods are employed to
        fix return cranks, ranging from pinned and bolted,
        slotted and bolted and simply bolted connections, each
        has its merits. That employed on Pixie is straightforward
        to make and effective in service. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the die blocks installed in their guides the vibrating
        lever can be set into place, the top secured by the pivot
        bolt in the die-block and the bottom by a cap with a
        countersunk screw. Next comes the installation of the
        valve rod. Here it should be mentioned that wherever a
        connection is made with a simple pivot pin, the pin
        should be retained by a split cotterpin. Holes for minute
        split pins tend to wander in the course of drilling
        through the fork and the pin, and some time can be
        expended in attempting to reinsert split pins after a
        service or routine maintenance. A small punched mark made
        when holes for such minute split pins are drilled through
        the forks and pins will identify the resident pins with
        the forks and also the correct orientation of those pins
        within the forks. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">REVERSING
        LEVER </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        many locomotive the reversing lever and sector plate can
        be assembled independent of any part of the
        superstructure. On Pixie this is not the case as the
        sector plate depends for support at each end from bolts
        through the inner face of the right hand bunker. To
        facilitate access and valve setting a temporary bracket
        was fabricated to provide support at these points and the
        lever and reach rod installed. The front end of the rod
        pivots on a stud secured into a lug on the bottom of the
        slide. The rear end of the rod, forks over the reversing
        lever which in turn, pivots on a fulcrum bolt on the
        bunker side, replicated on the the temporary bracket.
        There are occasions such as this when a temporary
        arrangement allows access for adjustment which would be
        difficult to make with everything permanently in place.
        This time the use of the temporary bracket permitted the
        notches for the latch to be marked before the stage of
        final erection. The notches were actually cut after
        removal of the bracket and final erection of the sector
        plate and bunker assembly onto the bunker side. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">VALVES
        AND VALVE SETTING </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        slide valves were dropped into place in the valve chest.
        The gland nuts were threaded onto the valve spindles
        which were inserted into the glands on the valve chest,
        not forgetting to insert the ' O ' ring packings. The rod
        was then passed through the first of the retaining
        collars, the slot in the valve, the second collar and
        then into the tail guide. Now the valve rod could be
        installed and the pins inserted. Valve setting followed
        the normal procedure of adjusting the position of the
        slide valve on the valve spindle, locking the collars
        when the optimum position had been established. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        has to be remembered that the collars must allow the
        spindle freedom in the vertical direction such that steam
        pressure in the valve chest forces the valve onto the
        port face. Now the weighshaft brackets can be fixed into
        their final position, also the position of the notches on
        the sector plate can be marked in full forward and full
        reverse. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        the event of a need to modify valve arrangements it is a
        great help if a set of perspex ' slide valves ' are
        produced. These can be simply made from 1 / 8&quot;
        perspex sheet, joined by using plastic solvent. The
        exhaust recess can be scribed and coloured-in using
        marking blue. The dummy valves can be threaded onto the
        valve spindle and the events viewed as the locomotive is
        moved back and forth along a short length of test track. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the valves set the valve chest cover can be installed, it
        is advisable that all the studs should be inserted and
        the cover checked for location prior to finally inserting
        the gasket and tightening down the nuts. This will avoid
        the situation sometimes encountered where, due to minor
        inaccuracies in hole location, the cover binds on one of
        the many studs and fails to seat down properly ! For the
        cover / valve chest joint, liquid gasket has proved
        satisfactory in service, and certainly saves a
        considerable amount of work otherwise required in the
        manufacture of traditional gaskets. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        TRIAL RUN ON AIR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        this stage it is more than likely that, with the the
        engines attached to the frame and with the motion work
        installed, the builder will want to have a trial run.
        This can be carried out at the bench on compressed air
        with the frames set upon packing. The writer felt the
        urge at this stage to prove the work to date. In the
        absence of a length of track Pixie's first run was on the
        floor of a local garage. The frames complete with motion
        and a temporary steam inlet pipe were taken to the
        garage, the only source at that time of an adequate
        supply of air. To the amazement of two young mechanics,
        who whilst having intimate knowledge of the workings of
        motor car engines were apparently ignorant on the working
        of steam, the ' mechanism ' shot twenty feet across the
        workshop floor on the end of the air line, like a scalded
        cat. Remarkably too, on resetting the reversing lever and
        opening the regulator it shot back again. The power
        developed by the small engines had to be seen to be
        believed. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Such
        excitement! After more than seven years and much figuring
        and speculation as to the effects of scaling down parts
        of the valve gear, it's geometry, the steam chest
        dimensions and the dozen or so components of each engine,
        the thing worked, and powerfully too. In retrospect the
        whole proposition of a concrete engineer manufacturing
        such a complex mechanism in miniature, and one that
        worked as intended on first trial, seemed as unlikely as
        the prospect of the construction industry, as we know it,
        putting a man into space! </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        smokebox can be secured onto the saddle, here stainless
        steel bolts are advisable. These can be turned up from
        stainless steel hexagon stock of the appropriate size. It
        is a good thing to hold a stock of the common sizes of
        hexagon material in stainless for bolts, and brass for
        unions. When there are a few minutes to spare between
        other jobs, or when only a limited time can be allocated
        for the workshop, a few unions can be turned up or the
        odd bolt prepared without too much upheaval and without
        too much effort in setting up machinery. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">BOILER
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Boiler
        installation will render the space between the frames
        rather less than accessible so that it makes sense to
        insert any pipe runs and make-up any joints in those
        pipes before finally locating the boiler into the
        smokebox ring and seating it onto the bearing brackets on
        the frames. First attempts at boiler installation onto
        Pixies frames involved considerable sweat and no little
        amount of personal injury ! Despite the fact that the
        boiler matched the dimensions from the survey in every
        detail, ( indeed the accuracy achieved was a great credit
        to the builder ), the boiler just would not seat into
        position...... Enter Giant Despair ! ......Several cups
        of tea and a breather later however, on resuming what
        until then had been a struggle, the boiler suddenly slid
        into position as it has indeed on subsequent occasions.
        There may have been ' Gremlins ' in the workshop on the
        occasion of the first attempts at installation, although
        more likely the interference was caused by some rogue
        rivet head or overlong bolt, eased in in the heat of
        subsequent operations. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the boiler installed a check should be made to see that
        the firebox end is free to move as expand everything
        heats up and the boiler expands. Holes in the bearing
        brackets need to be slotted to allow this movement as
        will those in brackets providing support for a saddle
        tank. The level of the boiler, relative to the frames,
        can also be checked and if necessary packings inserted at
        the bearing brackets. At this stage also, sufficient
        clearance can be established around blowdown valve (s)
        and if necessary any openings in stretchers adjusted as
        required. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">STEAM
        PIPE, EXHAUST PIPES AND BLOWER </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now
        the steam and exhaust pipes can be installed,. Some
        juggling is likely to be necessary to persuade these
        items into position through scale size apertures in the
        lower quarters of a smokebox ( Later thought was given to
        this and perhaps in a subsequent model, where some detail
        of the prototype is concealed in the model then some
        licence may be taken with sizes ! ) Eventually with such
        Chinese puzzles solved, the wet header can be bolted into
        place on the boiler bush ( not forgetting the 'O' ring
        seal ). The joints between the steam and exhaust pipe and
        the cylinder block can then made. Liquid gasket was used
        to seal these joints on Pixie and has proved perfectly
        effective in service. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the blower ring installed the plumbing can be completed.
        The parts of the pipes between apertures in the smokebox
        and the connections with the cylinder blocks are enclosed
        in a sheet steel cover, secured by tiny screws into
        tapped holes in the smokebox tube. To render the
        apertures airtight small quantities of modelling clay can
        be smoothed around the pipes from inside the smokebox
        using one of Messrs Proops ' Doofers '. These can be
        obtained from a MODEL ENGINEER exhibition stand and
        although they convey a fearsome reminder of time spent in
        the dentists chair will prove immensely useful about the
        workshop! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">REGULATOR
        AND REGULATOR BLOCK </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        regulator can be mounted within the steam dome, using
        stainless steel screws into the lugs on the regulator
        body. A check should be made at this stage to ensure that
        the screws on the actuating rods are wired to prevent
        them coming loose in service. Stainless steel wire is a
        must. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the regulator rod inserted into the regulator handle and
        the rod passed through the gland, the small bush can be
        set onto and secured to the rod by a stainless steel grub
        screw. This bears against the back of the body block,
        retaining the rod in its correct position within the
        regulator proper. The complete assembly can now be passed
        through the regulator block bush, the leading end being
        located in the back of the regulator body within the
        steam dome. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SAFETY
        VALVES AND HEADER PIPES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        the case of pixie, once the regulator and the regulator
        block and rod had been installed it was time to install
        the safety valve block and safety valve bodies. The block
        is in fact retained by the screwed portions of the valve
        bodies so that it became necessary to enlist the aid of
        the plastic gasket material once again. The fulcrum
        bracket which retains the safety valve balance beam
        screws into the safety valve block. The beam itself is
        mounted using a bolt as a pivot, the ends of the safety
        valve spindles move freely within bushes at the ends of
        the balance beam. Adjustment of the valves is achieved by
        screwed bushes set into those at the ends of the balance
        beam. Assembly of these items takes less time than is
        needed to write the description, although with such an
        important part of the ' works ' care has to be taken to
        ensure freedom of action of the parts. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PLATEWORK
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There
        are three running plates on PIXIE. The two outer, low
        level plates take support from brackets rivetted to the
        main frame members and rails which are bolted to the drag
        beam. These plates provide seatings for the side bunkers,
        and importantly, the brake standard. These items are each
        in turn clamped into position and the location of the
        fixing screws transferred to the plates using a centre
        punch. If the platework is of stainless steel the holes
        for the fixing screws has to be drilled using a freshly
        sharpened bit with sufficient pressure to ensure that the
        bitt cuts metal all the time. As has been noted
        elsewhere, the slightest rubbing action will heat the
        bitt and spoil its temper. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Once
        the lower running plates and the left-hand bunker are
        erected, the positions of the holes for the feedwater
        pipes from the hand pump in the left hand bunker can be
        established. Here pieces of stiff wire to replicate the
        pipes facilitates the marking process. The holes drilled
        the the pump can be installed on a mild steel block of
        sufficient height to bring the operating handle clear of
        the bunker ends at the extremes of the pump stroke. The
        brake standard is positioned on the right hand, lower
        running plate ( where it was located at the time of the
        survey, although there is evidence in the form of a set
        of mounting holes, that it has been set on the opposite
        side at some time in the locomotive's history ) and the
        fixing holes and the hole for the brake spindle spotted
        and drilled. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        middle, upper footplate will require trimming to fit
        around the frame angles, also slotting for the damper
        lever. this is another situation where it is advisable to
        produce a strong card template and carry out a trial fit
        prior to cutting metal. Clearance for the angles joining
        the drag beam to the frame members is easy to arrange by
        pure measurement. To avoid wasteful errors in positioning
        the slot, the template can be slotted on the known line
        of the lever. Inserted into position, the card can be
        marked to indicate the position of the ends of the slot
        and the footplate marked and cut accordingly. A small
        metal catch is bolted to the plate to engage in, and
        retain, the damper lever. This was bolted into position
        on the footplate and with marking blue and a scriber the
        correct angle and depth of the three slots in the lever
        were established. Provision of one last slot for the
        drain pipe from the water gauge permitted the plate to be
        dropped into place. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">BRAKE
        STANDARD, AND BRAKE GEAR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        main brake shaft with just the fixing bushes in place,
        was offered up and clamped into position, square across
        the frames and level. This allowed the cut-outs necessary
        to allow the bushes to seat onto the frame members to be
        determined, marked out, then cut and filed. The brake nut
        was then threaded onto the brake spindle and the handle
        rotated until the brake shaft complete with actuating
        arm, two bushes and two drop arms could be bolted into
        place. With the hangers and blocks installed by bolting
        to the frames, the pull rods could be inserted and the
        rods which serve as brake beams with their retaining
        bushes threaded into position. With all assembled the
        holes for the split pins which secure the bushes in place
        were drilled and the minute split cotterpins set into
        place. This size of split pin has extremely sharp ends,
        so beware! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        the running plate two bolts pass through support angles
        on the standard downwards into the angles supporting the
        floor member. The screwed portion of the brake shaft can
        be engaged in the bush within the brake fork below the
        running board and the handle turned until the foot of the
        column contacts the floor when the fixing bolts can be
        installed. At the top, the brake standard takes support
        from the cab backplate support angle and is bolted into
        position using a shaped strap, reminiscent of a gutter
        bracket. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">ASHPAN
        AND GRATE </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        the time of final erection the ashpan was set into
        position, clamped and blocked to prevent movement whilst
        the holes for retaining pins were drilled. After a lot of
        careful measurement, small diameter pilot holes were
        drilled through the mainframes and the ashpan sides.
        During the drilling of the holes a colleagues assistance
        was saught to sight the drill and ensure that the holes
        were put through horizontally. Transverse accuracy was
        obtained by lining the drill with a try-square set
        against the frames. The ashpan is located by two
        stainless pins, cross drilled for tommy bars at one end
        and tapered at the other to facilitate insertion. The
        pins themselves are retained by &quot;O&quot; Rings
        slipped into position once the pins are engaged. In the
        event of an emergency the grate can be dumped by
        withdrawing the pins when the ashcan will drop as far as
        the sleepers, spilling the fire. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SADDLE
        TANK </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">With
        the boiler seated into position and the boiler / smokebox
        joint made, the fastening angle for the front of the
        saddle tank can be installed. Although there are a number
        of bolts through the angle and the smokebox tube, only
        two of these are in fact bolted connections, the rest are
        dummies, this to reduce the amount of work when
        dissembling for maintenance in future. On Pixie, the rear
        of the saddle tank rests on two brackets supported from
        the boiler casing and the front takes its support from
        the aforementioned bracket. Studs projecting from
        stiffening plates which also serve to reinforce the
        delivery pipe connection points from the tank, pass
        through timber blocks into the boiler brackets. the
        timber blocks are for insulation purposes. again the
        holes in the mounting brackets have to be slotted to
        permit expansive movement of the boiler. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SUPERSTRUCTURE
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After
        the arduous work of boiler and tank installation, the
        erection of the superstructure affords time to relax and
        enjoy ! The rather elementary weather plate is supported
        on angle steels which in their turn take support from the
        backs of the bunkers. The back of the cab, again
        platework on angle framing takes support from the drag
        beam. The weather board and cab back plating support the
        roof which is bolted to the curved angle steels forming
        the top of the superstructure framing. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">MAKERS
        PLATES </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        this stage it was time to mount the makers plates ( which
        had been prepared earlier ! ) Mounted on each of the
        bunker sides these proclaim ' Kerr Stuart etc......&quot;
        Plates such as these are essential in conveying the
        atmosphere of the model and some thought was given to
        their production. The method eventually adopted was first
        to choose a photograph of one plate from the reference
        shots on transparency film. This slide was then projected
        onto a sheet of paper set on the workshop wall and the
        image drawn-over using indian ink to approximately five
        times the size of the required plates. These were
        photographed by a friend, to provide the required image
        size, using a film having high contrast negative
        emulsion. The negative was then sent to Messrs Reeves for
        the production of etched plates. The detail was etched
        onto brass plate of the required thickness. All that was
        then necessary was to saw and file these to profile,
        polish the edges and drill for the fixing bolts. A coat
        of enamel was applied overall, the plate was lightly
        filed to expose the letters then polished. With the
        availability of Digital Cameras this process can be
        simplified, and a dic with the appropriate photograph
        sent to the engraver the size being simply adjustable as
        required.</font></p>
