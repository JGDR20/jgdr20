        <p><font size="2"><strong>FOREWORD </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I have, over the last few years, had
        the pleasure of watching Pixie grow, from a design
        concept through to a finished locomotive. this has been
        thanks to occasional personal contact, and largely
        through the occasional articles submitted to MODEL
        ENGINEER magazine detailing progress to the latest stage.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The author is a meticulous craftsman,
        with a well developed and organised workshop, each
        feature being installed as a result of considerable
        thought. That he has chosen to set out this account of
        his activities, revealing both the triumphs and
        difficulties encountered in the construction, is a
        tribute to his meticulous recording of his work. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Of all the books that I have read
        concerning the building of small locomotives, this one
        adopts a novel approach, taking as a starting point the
        actual workroom or other premises which are to be used
        for the work. Very often this is a facet of locomotive
        building which is neglected; leading to considerable
        problems later. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I like the attention to detail, the
        account of the research needed to bring the product to
        fruition, the novel approach to pattern making, and the
        authors somewhat novel approach to gleaning much of the
        material needed. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This is a very readable account of the
        building of a well detailed locomotive and, as
        importantly, the many hints and tips of a practical
        nature passed for the benefit of other constructors by
        the author. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">One can only applaud his industry in
        making the volume available in this fashion, I for one
        wish the volume every success. </font></p>

    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Establishing detail.
    Research. Manufacturers drawings. Commercially available
    designs. Value of the model press, exhibitions and club
    membership. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">ESTABLISHING DETAIL </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">The amount of research
    required will depend upon whether the modeller chooses to
    produce an accurate scale model, or a near scale model. In
    the former case a massive amount of detail will be necessary,
    to the point of the sometimes derided ' rivet counting'
    exercise '. To embark on a scale model of a locomotive from
    'scratch' is to commit oneself to many months and perhaps
    years of work. For the scale modeller every detail has
    significance, every modification to the original design has
    be faithfully reproduced and incorporated into the model. The
    problem here is that the components may prove to be too
    delicate to stand up to service on the track and there has to
    be a temptation towards some judicious beefing-up of parts.
    Fortunately if the choice is a narrow-gauge model on 5 inch
    gauge track the various components will work up to be quite
    substantial and durable in use. . The near scale modeller
    whilst perhaps taking a more relaxed approach to detail has
    nevertheless to convey the atmosphere of prototype through
    the parts that he does include. He is fortunate in having the
    opportunity to make parts a little more solidly than they
    would be in true scale and thus a little less vulnerable to
    damage on the track. As we have said before modelling is a
    very personal process. Whatever the degree of scale accuracy
    is decided upon, careful research is required. The word '
    Research ' sounds quite impressive. In fact it really
    describes a process that every enthusiast follows naturally
    in the course of enjoying his hobby, that of ferreting out
    detail on a topic which he finds interesting. The sources of
    information are many and varied, ranging from contact with
    individuals having personal knowledge of the topic,
    manufacturers, museum archives, libraries, railway sites,
    Model Engineering Societies and Preservation Societies. Once
    one's mind is set on a particular prototype there seems no
    end to the sources of information. The only problem is that
    in the back of one's mind there is always always the feeling
    that some source is being overlooked. The modeller may rest
    assured however, if there is some inaccuracy or anachronism,
    someone with expert knowledge will probably put him right at
    time of the models first public appearance! </font></a></p>

    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">MANUFACTURERS DRAWINGS
    AND PHOTOGRAPHS </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">We may be fortunate
    enough to have a sight of manufacturers drawings, if not
    directly, at second hand. Many of the books on narrow-gauge
    railways shew illustrations of these drawings which can be
    worked-up for use as detail in constructing a model.
    Photographs of locomotives in the outshopped state are an
    institution. No manufacturer ' worthy of his salt' would have
    outshopped a locomotive and sent it away to his customer
    without having it photographed in its pristine state. These
    photographs are worth their weight in gold to the
    enthusiastic model engineer who can enlarge detail and glean
    useful information for model making purposes. Failing works
    drawings or manufacturers photographs, the authors of many of
    the series of construction articles published in the model
    press base their work and the drawings accompanying the text
    on detail taken from manufacturers drawings. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Some books such as
    those on narrow-gauge lines noted in the bibliography
    include, as appendices, quite detailed drawings of the
    locomotives and stock of the lines they describe. When
    supplemented by detail derived from the photographic
    illustrations, these small scale drawings can provide
    sufficient detail for the model engineer wishing to produce a
    near scale model. Typical of these, and on the face of things
    an unlikely source book i s ' Narrow Gauge Railway Modelling
    ' by D A Boreham. Intended for workers in 7mm scale this book
    includes nicely produced general assembly drawings of such
    locomotives as Locomotives 1 &amp; 2 of the Festiniog Railway
    and 'Mary' by W. G. Bagnall as worked by Cliffe Hill Granite
    Company. The book ' The Lynton and Barnstable Railway
    1895-1935' by L.T. Catchpole includes works line drawings of
    the three Manning and Wardle locomotives and the Baldwin
    which reveal essential detail for the modelmaker. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Over the years some
    excellent, and generally quite accurate, outline drawings
    have been published in the model railway press devoted to 4mm
    and similar scale modelling. These drawings provide a basis
    for an excellent model when used in conjunction with standard
    details of parts gleaned from the pages of MODEL ENGINEERING
    and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE and such standard works as LBSCs
    ' Shop Shed and Road ' and Martin Evans ' Manual of Model
    Steam Locomotive Construction '. Whilst, in the main, these
    books cater for the modeller working on standard gauge,
    mechanical principles do not vary from those of the narrower
    gauge. As discussed earlier much of narrow-gauge mechanical
    engineering sre of simpler design than that of the big stuff
    but there is no reason why, hidden within the ' innards ' of
    a narrow gauge locomotive, one should not employ more
    advanced methods. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">RESEARCH </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">A visit to the local
    library will reveal a wealth of publications touching upon
    the subject of narrow-gauge railway operations, locomotives
    and rolling stock. A brief perusal of the advertisements in
    the model press will serve to remind us of the considerable
    number of books available for purchase. A search of the stock
    on the bookstall at the next model railway exhibition will
    yield a surprising amount of information which is specific to
    narrow gauge. In the run-up to commencing a model, it is
    worthwhile copying or noting for reference material likely to
    be useful when the work begins. Often one encounters
    photographs showing useful detail in the most unlikely
    places. Newspapers, magazines, guide books and holiday
    advertisements have all yielded useful data in their time.
    The writer with his interest in sketching and drawing decided
    to measure from the prototype, meanwhile enjoying the visits
    to the line and contact with the volunteers working on the
    stock there. This may not be a feasible approach for many and
    other means of establishing detail become imperative.
    Brochures, postcards, and some posters for the Leighton
    Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway provided photographs, which were
    of immense value in confirming detail achieved from survey.
    The modeller will do well to seek out similar details of his
    projected prototype. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Researching a model can
    be tremendous fun. Recent research took the writer to an
    industrial museum in the Midlands to meet a voluntary
    archivist. Working in the bowels of the museum this
    gentleman, a volunteer with years of experience within the
    engineering industry, specific to locomotive design and
    construction behind him, spends his time cataloguing works
    drawings saved from destruction at the time of the demise of
    an internationally known manufacturer. He has become known to
    many enthusiasts and is constantly called upon to supply
    information on requests from correspondents all over the the
    world. In fact, so busy are he and a colleague, that they
    cannot publicise their facilities in case excess demand
    should bring their activities to a halt! Perhaps in the
    course of research the reader will be fortunate enough to
    meet similar kind folk. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">COMMERCIAL DESIGNS </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">During the past 20
    years there have been many series of articles on the
    construction of narrow-gauge locomotives, notable are those
    on the construction of CONWAY, a freelance narrow-gauge 0-4-0
    Saddle Tank locomotive for 3 1/2 inch gauge by Martin Evans,
    in MODEL ENGINEER of 1980. Other practical designs are the
    freelance model ' SWEET PEA ' mentioned earlier in this book
    and described in a series of articles in ENGINEERING IN
    MINIATURE. Whilst such designs are initially prepared for the
    benefit of the readers of the journal, commercial concerns
    soon set themselves up to provide the necessary materials and
    particularly castings for featured locomotives. In this way
    the modeller gains the advantage of an economic supply of raw
    materials and is, should he so wish, relieved of the work of
    producing his own patterns </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">The model engineer
    should not overlook designs for which part, or fully
    machined, sets of parts are available, particularly as these
    models have been built in large numbers and have proved
    themselves as runners on tracks throughout the world. Kits of
    ready machined parts such as those available from Messrs
    MAXITRACK have served to introduce many modellers to the
    delights of model engineering. Once having assembled a model
    from a set of parts, production and assembly of ones own
    parts seems just a small step to take. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">THE MODEL PRESS,
    PUBLICATIONS, EXHIBITIONS AND CLUB MEMBERSHIP </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">As will be evidenced by
    the frequent references in this book, the writer is an avid
    reader of a number of model engineering publications. These
    range from MODEL ENGINEER and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE to the
    excellent series of publications by such firms as ARGUS BOOKS
    and THE OAKWOOD PRESS. Magazines devoted to specialised
    topics such as small scale railway modelling have information
    to offer. It is well worth taking time to note articles which
    contain detail which can prove useful at some later date, a
    note of the magazine or source made in the diary or logbook
    can save hours of searching later. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Most of the existing
    narrow gauge railways have a bookshop at the main depot as do
    industrial museums up and down the country. Stocks within
    these shops often contain valuable information for the
    would-be modeller, most for example have some write-up of the
    history of the line and its equipment, or in the case of
    museums a description of a specific locomotive exhibit,
    containing valuable illustrations. Picture postcards and
    posters are another source of information and with care can
    be used to supplement surveys and drawings. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">National and Local
    Exhibitions provide an opportunity for contact with trade
    suppliers, and other enthusiasts who can provide leads on
    sources of information. The models exhibited often reveal
    useful detail, and contact with the producer can assist in
    extending ones knowledge of methods and techniques. There is
    often a stand where known experts give demonstrations and
    provide advice on problems. Bookstalls at exhibitions can
    provide a useful source of information, on occasions it has
    been possible to pick up a years back numbers of journals for
    quite reasonable sums, reasonable when one considers the
    wealth of information contained therein. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Club membership has a
    great deal to offer, particularly where the newcomer to model
    engineering is concerned. There is never any shortage of
    know-how or advice. Frequently one or other of the members is
    specialist in or has specific knowledge of a particular
    railway, having perhaps worked on the line or more recently
    done voluntary work in preservation. Club membership may well
    present other advantages such as access to machines and
    services and sometimes discounted prices on materials from a
    local supplier. Local club programmes often include talks and
    demonstrations by visiting speakers, specialist in some
    branch of model making such as boilermaking, painting and so
    on, these events are particularly beneficial to the beginner.

    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">After cutting lengths
    from stock materials remove burrs before returning offcuts to
    stock. Ensure that your workplace is well lit, warm, and well
    ventilated. You are going to spend many hours of your life
    there if you intend to make a model locomotive !</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Check the fixity of
    jigs, templates and the workpiece after initial cuts, and in
    the course of the work especially when intermittent cuts are
    being made.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Vary your work pattern.
    Changes improve your interest level and aid concentration,
    never force yourself to work on your model if there are

    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Make the best use of
    odd spare moments in the workshop. Whilst you may feel
    compelled to press on with some major part there are always
    tools which will benefit from sharpening or nuts, olives or
    other small parts to be made. Sometimes it is nice to just
    sit in the workshop and think about the next move,often we
    don't do enough of this!</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Keep a notebook. Note
    detail changes, record thread sizes and sequence of erection.

    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">If you store tools in
    the same place between each use, you will find them quickly
    when you need them, especially important in emergency, when
    you need one in a hurry !</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Keep workshop tools in
    the workshop, try to avoid having some parts of your kit in
    the car or the garage, in these cases they are rarely where
    you actually need them for the work in hand.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">If you mislay a tool
    within the workshop, start to clear up, the tool will soon
    emerge from its hiding place, under something or behind
    something else ! </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Make a note of loans.
    With the best of intentions, friends and acquaintances often
    forget the source of a loan and tools get lost forever that
    way.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Always sharpen tools
    after use, that way they will be ready for use when next
    needed.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="4" face="Technical"><strong>MATERIALS</strong></font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Store materials
    methodically, they will be easier to locate and shopping
    lists become easier to prepare when available stock is
    visible.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Maintain a ' shopping
    list ' it is easy to forget some stock requirement when
    surrounded by all the interesting items at your stockist's
    emporium !\</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Visit your model
    engineering materials supplier other than at peak periods.
    The man behind the counter has seen it all before. He hears
    accounts of success and failure, knows of the effectiveness
    of various techniques and can advise on materials
    applications.</font></a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">You will find that the
    supplier knows his stocks and can advise on alternatives,
    particularly such items as near -size castings which with
    some small modification can be adapted for use in your
    particular model.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Where funds allow, buy
    additional pieces of frequently used standard materials, the
    offcuts will always prove useful.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Keep aggressive
    materials, acids, chemicals etc. in a locked metal cabinet. </font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Always mark containers
    to indicate the contents, unmarked containers are dangerous.
    Maintain a well ordered scrap box, view materials with an eye
    to alternative uses to which they can be applied, a scrap
    radio, TV set or even a video cassette can yield endless
    numbers of useful screws, brackets and so on. The older,
    timber TV cabinets can be transformed into storage shelving,
    or the material which will be well seasoned can provide
    mounts or bases for models.</font></a></p>
    <p><a><font size="2" face="Technical">Save those chucking
    pieces, they can provide the material for a valve gland or
    some other small part</font></a></p>

the 'Counsel of perfection', but we do manage to achieve some of
the recommendations !</font></a></p>
