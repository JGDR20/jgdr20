<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Technical">In line with
my philosophy of building cheap ( but to the best standard my
skills allow ) I set out to build a boat that would replicate the
manner in which full size boats sail, not whipping about at mad
speeds as, for instance, some kit boats do.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Technical">Attached are
some pictures of the construction and testing of the boat later
replicated in a larger, sister boat which I sail on my 'Home '
water, and some great sailing some time ago at Bognor, and
Taunton.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The boat
framing really was constructed from kitchen cupboard . They don't
make such knot free material any more ! It was cut down on my 45
year old bandsaw. The hollow mast was broomstick, sawn and then
milled out to provide the track, The keel is reinforced with
stainless steel ( Concrete reinforcing steel from a friendly
builder ) The bow and stern blocks were from redundant 'Queen
Anne ' legs from a damaged piece of furniture. The rigging
turnbuckles were from the wire wing stays of a Walrus flying
boat...the turnbuckles being gifted to me years ago by a WW2,
Naval airframe rigger. Rigging wire is model aircraft control
line wire which is immensely strong. Lead ballast was from the
local roofer ( Bought I have to add ! ). Sails are of Nylon /
terryene lining material intended for ladies dress linings. Paint
was domestic Dulux Gloss. Radio Control is in this case rudder
only, a sail winch may yet be installed..................rudder
only control is more demanding anyway.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Apart from the
sweat of the brow the total cost of the 1 Metre craft, , was that
of the 1.5 mm. ply, lead, PVA glue, lining material and control
wire was about £ 20..............not bad for hours of pleasure</font></p>

        pins. PVA adhesive is employed and the ply ihas to be '
        persuaded ' round difficult curves by wetting the outer
        veneer to make it supple. Casein glue would in itself be
        waterproof but as the PVA joints are protected by several
        coats of paint, it will suffice and is easier to use.

mention that a commercial concern in America claims to teach how
to sail larger boats using radio controlled model boats. I am
