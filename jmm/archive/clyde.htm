<p><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial">A model Clyde
'Puffer ' in my workshop <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>The model, one of my
fleet of six assorted craft, was kit built by an ex-naval type.
It was sailed a few times then spent 10 years or so in a
cupboard, as was the radio complete with batteries which '
bloomed '.&nbsp; The Puffer was then gifted to me, gratefully
received promptly renovated. The prop shaft had seized up, not
due to corrosion but to decomposing grease, and soon responded to
a spot of grease of the elbow variety. The wiper type speed
controller board was replaced with a with a BEC, as in each of my
boats. So to the pond a few days later and an enjoyable hour or
so sailing. It is a great favourite at the lake as it looks
quaint and sails convincingly, also many of the older folk
remember it as the vessel that the old reprobate ' Para Handy '
skippered in a television series of years ago.</font></p>
