        small pusher tug</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">This
        project came to mind when I came across illustrations of
        a small pusher tug, typical of probably hundreds which
        are on lake and harbour duties about the world. The 'Springer
        ' tug has caught the imagination of model makers and the
        ' Springer .( Model ) class has become established. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">There are
        set rules for Springer class competitions including set
        hull lines and dimensions, propeller and rudder size and
        also motor power. These details are available from
        Springer sites about the web and in the UK from Martins
        excellent pages at </font><a

        <p><font face="Arial">There is a saying among modellers
        that ' <em>There is a prototype for everything</em> ' . A
        look around the marine pages on the web proves that this
        is indeed the case and one of the joys of building '
        freelance fashion ' is that any detail which takes the
        builders fancy can be included in his models !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This feature of having a design for
        a proven performing hull can be a great asset to
        scratchbuildersand brings to mind another site which
        shews details of an unusual hull design fora larger boat
        suited to a more powerful motive power and with plenty of
        hull space fror electronic gizmos.Now back to my build......</font></p>

        project was chosen as a break from more demanding work
        and was to be built ' On a shoestring ' from scrap, odds
        and ends of wood and using accumulated bits and pieces
        left from previous models. Ply will be the main purchased
        item.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">As my
        projected model is not for competive sailing I introduced
        more interesting plan shape by kerfing the side members
        and fitting fillets to widen the beam at about the third
        point. Ordinary household PVA adhesive is used throughout
        as it will be protected by shellac and several coats of
        paint ( Dulux interior primer, undercoat and gloss ) I
        bought a gallon of PVA adhesive years ago from a building
        supply stores and over the years it has saved me a great
        deal of cash compared with buying in small tubes and
        bottles !</font></p>

        having been installed earlier, the position of access
        hatches to the ' works ' could be established and
        suitable bearers fixed to support the joints between
        hatches and fixed areas of deck.</font></p>

        construction here is strongly built to resist forces from
        pushing or recovering another boat. As can be seen from
        images throughout my pages, the plastic clips, available
        from ' Pound shops ' are invaluable tin much of the
        building process.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Watertightness
        of hatches can be ensured by using the elastic type of
        gasket seal from the tube. Applying the gasket gel to the
        bearing surface of the joint after painting and then
        placing the painted and lightly greased (Vaselined )
        hatch cover will form a gasket whilst permitting the
        cover to be removed and replaced as required.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">When
        laying ply decking with inserts such as hatches and
        coamings it makes sense to form the opening, shape and
        place the insert, pinning hatches lightly in place, then
        lay decking between the insert and the the hull edges, in
        this way one can obtain the best fit between insert and
        the surrounding deck. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Where
        adhesive is used adjacent to a part to which no adhesive
        should stray ................clingfilm prevents adhesion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Dental burrs are ideal for
        cutting apertures in up to 3/16&quot; ply. Whilst the
        dentist tells me that his drills run at 200,000 r.p.m,
        when cutiing ply I find that 5,000 r.p. m ( a speed
        within the capability of most 'mini drills' ) is fine.
        Where cooling vents are being modelled the expanded
        aluminium supplied in motorbody repair kits can provide a
        suitable grille material. In this case, as with glazing,
        the grille will be fixed after the paint job is complete.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The next step has been to install
        the pushposts. These have been remade following research
        on the Internet where push posts ar generally taller that
        those as the saying goes ' I prepared earlier '. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">In scratch building, construction
        methods must be devised as work proceeds. Having built ' <em>Freelancers
        1 &amp; 2</em> ' I have found it essential to make card
        templates for items such as rounded and inclined stern
        bulwarks. Card from a cornflakes box is ideal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Having cut the parallel sides on
        the card to bulwark height the template can be lightly
        pinned in place then bent and inclined such that the
        tumblehome is as required. It is then a simple matter to
        mark top and bottom of the template for cutting to
        maintain the bulwark height required as well as a being a
        good fit on the deck side. The profile of the template
        can then be transferred to the ply, ensuring that the
        grain of the outer veneers is vertical at the centre of
        the bend. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">As usual with bends, dampening the
        outer veneer will assist in the acheiving the required
        shape. It is best to avoid joints in ply at any sort of
        rounded corner otherwise alignment and maintenace of line
        becomes a problem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">After part glueing has been carried
        out and the ply fitted snugly all round the best joint
        between parts will be acheived by overlapping the
        sections after fixing the bend and whilst the ends are
        free of glue cutting the eventual joint with a sharp
        blade prior to completing the glueing.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">The wheelhouse has been completed </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The railings around the upper deck
        have been built insitu. The whole deck and wheelhouse are
        removable, the engine room is firmly fixed to the hull
        and provides space for fing fuse, switch, Esc. etc.</font></p>
