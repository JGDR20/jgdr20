    <p><font size="5" face="Technical"><strong>An early start</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">My first
    workshop</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4"
    face="Technical"> </font><font color="#0000FF" size="3"
    face="Technical">was a delapidated shed next to my parent's
    house. ' Rag, tag and bobtail ' ancient tools belonging to my
    father comprised the equipment. With these I built many
    models, Mainly due to the period in which I was working WW2,
    I built waterline models of the great Battleships of the era,
    ' Hood ', ' Warspite ', 'Nelson 'and ' Rodney '. among many
    more. Imagine my dismay as I heard on the wireless, our main
    source of news, pre-television, that these grand ships were
    being sunk, one after the other !</font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Model
    aircraft followed....most crashed on first rubber powered
    flight. At 16 with some money in my pocket I started with
    model railways, making track from Peco chairs which were
    placed individually prior to rail insertion, thousands of
    them. Articles at the time in <strong>'Railway Modeller' </strong>showed
    my locomotives, then constructed from curtain rail and cocoa
    tin. This interest survived 3 years of Army service
    and...............</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4"
    face="Technical">so continued an all embracing model hobby '
    mania '...............still enjoyed 65 years on.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="5" face="Technical"><strong>Finding
    space</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Before and
    after army service and throughout my early married life
    various other locations were found, garages, spare rooms and
    even on one occasion a worktop in the lavatory. Things
    progressed and a decent tool kit was assembled then 32 years
    ago I built a house extension with a bespoke workshop. This
    was described in the '<strong>Model Engineer' </strong>titled
    '<strong> A quart into a pint pot ' </strong>Which it was ! </font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The room
    is just 3.5 metres square with two windows and , such luxury,
    centrally heated !</font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">It was
    necessary to make the most of every bit of space yet allowing
    room to work.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The page
    below is from Model Engineer, the then Editor Ted Jolliffewas
    impressed by the use of such a small space that he visited
    the workshop and took the photographs</font></p>

    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Being
    tight for space means that everything has to be removable or
    in store yet readily accessible. The best contribution to
    ease of work was the construction of a solid, yet mobile,
    central bench, that could be moved adjacent to the current,
    dirty or clean bench or to a particular machine to provide
    continuity of surface area. This also proved useful in moving
    heavy models about the shop.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Technical"><strong>It
    is essential however to remember that castor mounted benches,
    tool boxes or stands can become unstable if the rotation of
    the of the castors reduces their floor contact below the
    desired 3 to 1 height to base+load ratio.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The <strong>'
    Pint pot</strong> ' sufficed for 30 years or so until t I
    moved into the relatively spacious garage, pictured here with
    most of the equipment installed. Most of the cabinets from
    the pint pot have been installed and ther is now space for
    most of my models</font></p>

    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">'Up and over door'
    provides adequate ventilation ! Unfortunately in winter it
    must be sealed to prevent rust attack on tools and equipment.
    The floor is concrete painted light grey to assist in
    spotting those small items which get dropped...a disadvantage
    of concrete is that one cannot hear small items as they land,
    and also, as it is so smooth, small parts depart into the
    most difficult to reach places !</font></p>

    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">I maintain ' Clean '
    and ' Dirty ' benches ( For use as the descriptions imply !)
    The vices are on baseboards which can either be exchanged
    from one bench to the other or removed to provide a clear
    working space. This is achieved by using ' Screwfix ' bench
    stops which provide a strong clamping force.</font></p>

        and lighting are from skips ( given permission ) and
        shopfitters scrap, as is all the Dexion angle used for
        framing. It seems that every new shop demands a refit,
        the waste materials can be a goldmine for the economic
        minded, environmentally aware ! The bench shown left
        front is on heavy duty castors and can be moved to extend
        othe benches or move heavy models. The false ceiling
        suspended from the rafters provides storage space.</font></p>
