<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The plans were
first published as ' Freebies ' in Model Boats, May 1988 issue. I
put them aside with a mental note to think about building a model
some time in the future. Last year thoughts returned to building
the ' Egrete ' a Rhine pusher, which I believe is one of two
similar craft working the river today.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Egrete is
interesting as it has a deckhouse on a supporting scissors
mechanism which permits it to be lowered when passing under many
of the bridges encountered in its work. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Working on the
water,the prototype embeds the substantial anchors at the stern
in the river bed, to secure the boat whilst the barges which it
is to tranport are winched back against the push posts on the bow
by wiches in the winch house at the bow. This is essential to
ensure that the barges are securely attached and that that the
load can be navigated safely in the congested river, especially
when passing under the bridges, which in itself is a feat of
navigation, particularly where the bridges are on a curve as in
Basel !</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The published
plans ( Still available from Nexus ) are for a model constructed
using styrene sheet but, although I have great regard for the
work of&nbsp; Richard Webb in this medium,&nbsp;the engineer in
me demands something more substantial. I decided on timber and
ply construction throughout.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Having found
an ( almost ) perfectly flat building board, flat enough for the
purpose that is......... how could it be perfectly flat ? And
having purchased a mint set of drawings, battle commenced.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The timber
frames and strakes were constructed using timber recovered from
the carcass of redundant kitchen cabinets. The material used when
they were originally installed was knot free high quality pine
and could be ripped to size on the band saw and subsequently
planed to size. The joy being that the material cost nothing,
except my labour, that is ! The ply was marine quality 1.5mm ply
from the local model shop.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">With the
frames erected and true, with housings for the strakes cut, the
strakes were installed using brass pins and&nbsp; PVA adhesive,
bought by the 4.5 liter container. It is always useful around the
house and comes in at about 1/3 the price or less than the small
bottles in which it is otherwise sold. In passing I would add
that it is far more economic to buy hot glue sticks if needed by
weight at a building supply store than in the bubble pack at DIY
shops.</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Technical"> </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The hull is of
rectangular section throughout with only a small amount of strake
bending required at the bow, almost like building an inverted box
!</font></p>

        the motor mounts, also ply gussets in the sloping section

        hull.&nbsp; </font></td>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The hull
bottom sheeting was commenced, and the motors and propeller
shafts installed. Bottom sheeting was completed by persuading the
ply around the gentle upsweep at the bow. it is sometimes useful
to wet the outer veneer ( only ) where acute curves or changes of
plane are to be achieved.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Substantial
rails were inserted to allow firm fixings for the push posts to
be added later. This has since proved to be a wise move as these
posts take impact loading when coupling to a load, and when the
boat is handled with too much gusto by younger members of the
family !&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">At this stage
the hull was severed from the building board, always an exciting
moment.. With only the bottom sheeting installed the structure
proved to be extremely rigid, such that all further sheeting and
installation could be carried out without any distortion of the
hull.&nbsp; and with the hull in the position best suited to the
work.</font></p>

of the hull.</font></p>

design of the vessel permits the superstructure to be constructed
integral with the hull and deck, avoiding problems with water
ingress in ' Heavy weather '&nbsp; Decking throughout the hull

the push posts, sawn from hardwood, must be securely screwed in
place from within the hull.&nbsp;</font></p>

front and sides were reinforced with strip wood, placed to
provide support for the upper decks. Miscellaneous fixings and

twist. </font></p>

guides on the foredeck were built from brass rod and sheet brass.
Cyano was used to bond these materials, The decision taken at

the water that washes up the square bows at speed. </font></p>
