over the years, just as my interest grabbed me. They show various

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The prototype was one of the first
imported into the country and at 125 c.c. it proved to be a
trojan. My wife and I travelled the country, 36 000 miles to the
South Coast and Cornwall with petrol at two shillings and
sixpence a gallon providing 100 miles of travel. I eventually
added a sidecar for my wife and our firstborn baby child...magic

years agoto be enjoyed by my two sons it is actually from a kit

youngsters. Now with a more suitable power supply and a better
motor it does plane !</strong></font></p>
