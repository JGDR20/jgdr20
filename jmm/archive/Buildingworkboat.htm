<p><font color="#0000FF" size="5" face="Technical"><b>So I
decided to build another boat !</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical"><b>I had been
looking for a new project to occupy my time and give me something
to think about in otherwise dull times such as when shopping,
dishwashing and all the other similar chores.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical"><b>The present
fleet of boats includes two sailing cruisers, a Rhine pusher, a
fast launch, a Clyde Puffer and a crash tender so a workboat
offers the variety necessary to add interest. Freelancing would
also add to the fun as it would entail searching the web for
interesting layout and detail. Size is to match that of the
Pusher, Puffer and launch, such that they can all be accommodated
in the car As regards design the boat will include many of the
details that I enjoy when looking at the real thing.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical"><b>I regard it
a challenge to build mainly from scrap, except for the electrics

the timber the more likely it is to be knot-free and of general
good quality, superior to stock in the local DIY store ! Post WW2
ply is generally WBP (Simply tested by a good soaking ) and
anyway all will be protected by paint or varnish coatings.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The result of
the ' Bath test ' on the gift wrapped hull showed that the
intended waterline could be achieved later, and the material in
the sternworks would cause no problem weightwise. With 7lbs plus
of weight onboard the shell settled to 1/2&quot; above the
intended waterline so plenty of scope for a gel battery, sited
low in the ' guts ' of the boat, also motors, controls and
superstructure.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The structural
frame with its temporary supports proved sufficiently rigid to
allow fairing-off using a power planer, set to a very fine
cut...so much less hard work than rasp and hand plane. Anyone who
has built a full-size dinghy will know how much work fairing-off
makes ! The power planer was long enough to span the profiles and
thus cut the ' lands ' for the ply sheathing at the correct angle
to allow the 1.5mm ply skin to bed down properly. Care was needed
however, to ensure that the planer didn't gobble-up the
structural members !</font></p>

simply eats the stuff and leaves a smooth edge without ply
breakout. PVA adhesive is liberally applied and the pins are
driven in, working from stern to bow, ensuring that the ply is
fully seated on the formers. Where necessary a hunk of metal
provides a &#145; strongback &#145; such that the pin takes all
the driving force and the frame does not suffer shock. Pins can
be withdrawn or punched-in later.</font></p>

the build of ' Freelance ' 10th August 2004</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">I found a
picture of a workboat with a pushpost and am incorporating the
feature into ' Freelance ' with some difficulty owing to the bow
geometry. You have only to look at illustrations of the craft
that the construction industry use in offshore work to see the
immense variety available to the modeler, let's not put them all
on one boat though Eh !</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">So now it was
time to concentrate on the upper works. I gave myself a headache
with the geometry by having the deckhouse sides inclining inboard
as well as a change in line to maintain the side companionways at
a sensible width. The technique that resolved the problem was to
shape up each 3mm ply panel, hold it in place using small
G-clamps, fit the blocks that to stiffen the joints, then drill
and pin, leaving the pin heads proud for subsequent removal. On
their removal the small overlaps were sanded off, and corners
rounded using the minidrill. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">I use a 50 mm
diameter rubber sanding disc and stick standard, coarse wet and
dry to it using PVA. This holds the abrasive but allows easy
replacement. The disc is left under a weight overnight, to ensure
that the face of the freshly bonded wet and dry finishes up
perfectly flat. This all seems a palaver but a lot of discs can
be cut from one sheet of wet and dry </font></p>

hours into the build of ' Freelancer ' there is evident progress.
I suppose that after 70 hours of scratchbuilding I am at about
the stage that the kitbuilder is at when he opens the box. As it
is I have struggled some, I have this picture in my mind of what
I want the boat to look like, there are details from many boats
included in this build. ... railway modelers say <strong>' There
is a prototype for everything ',</strong> and so there is. You
have only to look at illustrations of the craft that the
construction industry use in offshore work to see the immense
variety available to the modeler, let's not put them all on one
boat though Eh !</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">I found a
picture of a workboat with a pushpost and am incorporating the
feature into ' Freelance ' with some difficulty owing to the bow
geometry.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">A large hatch
in the afterdeck will similarly serve the radio gear and servos.
The aft deckhouse, base for the funnels is a fixture. The
deckhouse structure is now complete except for cutting ports and
vents, the forward section is secured in place temporarily to
enable other detail to be lined up.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Technical">This is reassuring as
in practice they are protected by sealer and several coats of
