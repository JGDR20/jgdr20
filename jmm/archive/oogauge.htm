        Gauge Model Railways.... many years of a fun railway

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">For
        more years than I sometimes care to remember I have
        enjoyed model railways. In the early years, during and
        immediately post World WW2 everything had to be hand
        made, on the grounds of shortage of cash, materials and
        the expense of such proprietary equipment as was
        available. I constructed locomotive bodies from cocoa tin
        and frames from brass curtain rail. Rolling stock was
        card with printed overlays. Track was early Peco '
        Individualay ' which was built sleeper by sleeper and
        chair by chair on a card base stuck to the baseboard
        prior to the the rail being inserted and clenched into
        place using a special tool, so laborious but realistic.</font></p>

        Model Railway News featuring extremely simple layouts all
        built ' On a shoestring ' Many more layouts followed, in
        OO and TT Gauge, it being a feature of railway modelling
        thet few layouts are ' Really completed ' before ideas
        are formulated for the next !</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">In
        keeping with my ' economic ' ethic. Much of the materials
        in my layouts come from skips and shopfitters waste which
        yield timber ply and wire. Of course track, turnouts
        control and switchgear are bought in, though transformers
        and rectifiers can be rescued from defunct electrical
        equipment. Fun gear includes steam sound
        ....................and whistles for the kids ! All mains
        electricity is isolated from the layout, all electrics on
        the layout are maximum 18 volt d.c, so no possibility of
        shock. Having said that when tired at the end of a day,
        the writer can ' feel ' this current at the track !</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">Where
        space permits there is nothing to match a layout of which
        at least part is a continuous circuit. There is nothing
        quite like' Watching the trains go by ' as a way of
        passing the odd spare moment !</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">On the
        16' x 10' layout the two levels incorporated two complete
        circuits and a further ' Figure of eight' For added
        interest a spur to a terminus was introduced at one
        level. Such items as the concrete bridge in the middle
        distance have to be hinged or removable to enable access.
        Controls should be localised to a degree so that visitors
        can learn them quickly, A lot of American club layouts
        (And a few British ones ) have centralised controls with
        localised control however it is simpler for more than one
        operator to work the layout.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The
        layouts described here were built with fun in mind. They
        have been operated, and sections were until recently
        operated by Children, Grandchildren and ' Kids ' of all
        ages ( from 6 to 60 and on ) Whilst not of the highest
        visual standard the railways permitted realistic train
        movements and operational possibilities.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The
        last layout as will be seen comprised parts of the
        previous layout. It was retained as a fun thing for the
        younger generation, and a plaything for the writer ! Now
        the interest in model boats and need for extra workshop
        space has brought about the demise of the OO gauge hobby
        of 50 years or so. We have always to move forward,
        sometimes without glancing back !</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Technical">The
        last change of focus illustrated by the images below was
        that two sections of the 16' x 10' layout were condensed
        into a simple stand-alone ' L ' shaped layout or '
        Railway corner ' The sections were originally designed
        with this in mind and went on to provide fun and a
        challenge for visiting youngsters. For ease of operation
        by visitors all turnouts and section switches were
        clearly marked on diagramatic control panels.</font></p>
