        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        is quite pleasing to leave the locomotive unpainted as
        long as possible, the parts that won't rust that is.
        Unfortunately fingerprints on polished mild steel may
        rust overnight so that items such as the mild steel
        platework have to be painted on completion. Otherwise all
        the stainless, rustless, and gunmetal parts can be left
        unpainted so that one can enjoy the appearance of the raw
        metal. Some parts can be decorated, up to the time of
        painting, using the age-old technique of a split dowel in
        the lathe or the drill, with a piece of wet and dry paper
        set into the slotted end. this can be set to revolve at
        speed and the part then applied systematically to the '
        tool ' This imparts a finish akin to that from milling,
        although on a much finer scale. It looks good in the raw
        and, according to the strength of paper used, provides a
        nice key for a priming coat later. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">WORKPLACE
        AND EQUIPMENT </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever
        finish is selected, the results achieved will depend to
        some extent on the temperature of the workplace. An even
        temperature and a dust free environment are two key
        aspects to be considered when painting. Probably the
        worst place for the operation is the workshop as there is
        almost always a film of dust from machines and equipment
        which can easily be disturbed by the smallest draught.
        Good work can be carried out in in a greenhouse or in a
        spray booth set up temporarily using polythene dust
        sheets from the local D.I.Y store. Small parts have been
        sprayed in a sink in the utility room, the water set
        running over the back surface of the sink by a piece of
        card, simulating the wet back in some commercial spray
        booths. In the writer's early days of modelmaking, a good
        sized cardboard box for a booth, with a larger box placed
        overall whilst the paint dried, yielded quite
        satisfactory results. Latterly a simple ' spray booth '
        for small parts has been fabricated from a steel box,
        using one of Messrs Proops brushless fans and a length of
        spin-drier hose to take away the overspray. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Regarding
        equipment, the range is enormous, from simple spray guns
        to sophisticated airbrushes. Expensive equipment does not
        guarantee good results, choice is likely to be based upon
        one's budget and, provided preparatory work has been
        carefully carried out, good work can be achieved with
        simple equipment. With sound preparation a combination of
        simple tools used skillfully and ongoing care taken in
        rubbing down and finishing, an excellent paint job will
        result. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Spray
        guns and airbrushes require a satisfactory air supply.
        Cans of propellant are expensive and are soon used up in
        the course of coating the many parts of a locomotive. For
        economy, a small electric tyre pump can be used to
        provide an air supply via an inner-tube as a reservoir, (
        the writer once re-sprayed a motor cycle using only a car
        footpump ! ). Compressors provide a reliable, consistent
        source of supply and need not be expensive although a
        filter must be used to provide a clean supply. There have
        been several articles in the model engineering press on
        adapting compressors from refrigerators. One very clear
        description was that by Steve Ballinger entitled ' An
        Airbrush Compressor ' in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE Vol 2,
        No.5 October 1980. It is important that some form of
        pressure regulator is used as varying paint consistency
        calls for a means of controlling the pressure. The simple
        ' external mix ' gun can, with care, provide a good
        finish although mix adjustment has to be carried out
        between actuations. The ' internal mix ' tool is probably
        more favoured by the professional and expert, providing
        as it does more immediate control of the air / paint mix
        at the touch of the trigger. For occasional use an
        electric, airless spraygun can provide an economic
        solution and again, excellent results can be achieved
        with care. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Other
        equipment includes lint-free cloth, wet and dry paper,
        rubbing compound, metal polish, masking tape and an
        endless supply of newspaper. Masking film and masking
        fluid will be useful to protect polished parts and to
        mask-off in the course of developing a livery. An
        out-of-date telephone directory will provide a good
        source of paper for masking purposes and on which to sit
        small parts for painting and some stiff wire hooks will
        be useful for handling and ' hanging out ' the parts to
        dry. A turntable such as those used in icing cakes will
        also prove useful. A good supply of thinners appropriate
        to the paint system to be used is essential. Where paint
        and thinners are concerned small tins are wasteful. Both
        materials will be cheaper if purchased in sensible
        quantities from a paint supplier. Your local dealer will
        advise on the type of solvent to be used according to the
        system selected. Paints will keep in the can for years
        provided it is properly sealed, the lid firmly replaced
        and a seal formed by inverting the can before storage. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Spaying
        small parts is simplified and can be carried out in the
        workshop if a suitable facility is provided. The simple
        cabinet illustrated at the top of this chapter has proved
        effective and useful. The ply box has two fans from
        defunct computers mounted high at the back. Extracted air
        and spray is blown into a cone-shaped funnel, which
        mounts on the ply back, into a length hose from a tumble
        drier and out of a window. At the front of the box a
        strip of perspex prevents overspray from escaping. The
        whole somewhat ' Sid Carnow ' cabinet can be packed
        together taking the minimum amount of space in a busy
        workshop.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TYPES
        OF PAINT </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Firstly
        a decision is required regarding the type of paint to be
        used. The choices range from cellulose and acrylic car
        sprays, through enamels, to special heat resistant paints
        such as those intended for automotive use. The choice
        rests with the individual, but whatever system is
        selected it has to be remembered that sound preparation
        is critical to achieving a good finish. A colleague calls
        the painting stage ' the spoiling stage ' and this it may
        well prove to be if the preparatory work is hurried or
        not carried out systematically. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Contact
        with the suppliers of various types of paint systems
        reveals an interesting fact. On investigation, the
        majority of complaints regarding substandard finishes
        achieved across a wide range of materials result from
        failure on the part of the user to read, or comply with
        the manufacturers instructions. Whilst it might be argued
        that the manufacturer is bound to come up with this
        conclusion, it has been proved time and time again that
        similar products have produced differing results in the
        hands of different people. It seems that when all else
        fails, when the paint fails to dry, or to provide the
        required surface, the user turns to the instructions, or
        complains to the makers! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">PREPARATION
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">LBSC
        used to advise washing parts to be painted in petrol,
        this seems a risky business and today a thorough wash in
        detergent, a rinse and then drying in a warm spot is
        probably more effective. The aim here is to remove all
        traces of oil, grease and cutting fluid which will
        otherwise prevent the priming coats bonding to the metal.
        Failure to remove grease will be evidenced by wrinkling
        of the early coats of primer. Should this be observed
        then the best course will be to go back to the bare
        metal, thoroughly degrease and start again. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever
        paint system is to be used, the same steps are required
        in preparation of the surfaces for paint. Paint will not
        mask irregularities of surface, it will not fill joints
        and it certainly won't fill holes in castings! Minor
        defects in castings can be filled with a polyester or
        epoxy filler and rubbed down to the required form, a rasp
        will cut away any overfill and a scraper can be used to
        take the repair to the stage where wet and dry paper will
        finish the job. Castings and any nonferrous surfaces
        should be coated with an etching primer, obtainable from
        any good automotive paint supplier. This should again be
        cut down using wet and dry paper, recoating and rubbing
        as necessary to produce a consistent matt surface to
        accept the selected paint. Filler is next, this fills any
        minor defects and can be carefully cut back using wet and
        dry paper until an allover, dead smooth surface results.
        The paper should always be supported, using small blocks
        of wood or a hard rubber block to ensure that the
        thickness of coating is left consistent throughout, and
        that corners are not exposed, or rounded out. The surface
        should now be dried. Wiping with a lint-free cloth helps,
        as does leaving the coated part on a radiator for an hour
        or two or spend some time using a hair dryer, the latter
        technique is good as it dries out all the little nooks
        and crannies in a complex part. Take time, attempt to
        speed things up and the painting stage will rapidly
        transform into my colleagues ' spoiling stage ' ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Next
        is the priming stage, here we are building the surface
        which will finally be apparent. The smoothness of finish
        achieved at this stage determines the appearance of the
        part after the application of the final coats of paint.
        This is true whatever paint system is adopted. Any small
        defect after this stage will be magnified by succeeding '
        finishing ' coats. The use of materials of differing
        colours up to this stage assists by indicating
        depressions and local defect. After each succeeding coat
        is rubbed down, high spots will be shown up by the
        previous colour, ' grinning through ' and local
        depressions retain the colour of the last coat applied.
        The aim is consistency and a uniform colouration all over
        the part. Once this stage is reached all is ready for the
        application of the final finishing coat (s) according to
        the selected sytem. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">ENAMEL
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Provided
        one is satisfied with the available colours, brushing
        enamel provides a good durable finish. It is always
        advisable to warm tins of enamel in a bowl of hot water
        prior to use. Don't shake the tin before use, open it and
        thoroughly stir the contents. Using enamel, applied by
        brushing, the finish will depend a great deal to the
        quality of the brushes used. Only brushes from a well
        known maker should be used, and they should be washed
        frequently using thinners and finishing with soap and
        water, as work on any large parts is carried out. This
        avoids problems and brush damage caused by enamel drying
        where the bristles are set into the handle. Carefully dry
        the brush after this cleaning operation, otherwise any
        moisture remaining in the brush will upset the paint
        consistency on restarting brushwork. Enamels can be spray
        applied although absolute cleanliness of the spray
        equipment is essential, and defects are not easily
        corrected. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst
        ideally one coat of enamel should provide a good quality
        finish, it is sometimes necessary to recoat. Previously
        coated parts should be set aside for the paint to harden
        before re-coating. A warm, dust-free spot is desirable, a
        cardboard box on top of the central heating boiler has
        proved effective in the past. Before re-coating, the
        surface should be lightly cut back taking care not to
        remove paint from the corners and edges of the piece.
        Work painted using enamel generally benefits from rubbing
        and buffing using automotive rubbing compound prior to
        finishing with metal polish, these processes should be
        carried out over a few square inches at a time, first
        rubbing, then buffing. A soft brush will be needed when
        polishing rivetted surfaces, care being taken to avoid
        exposing the metal of the rivet heads by rubbing too
        hard. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">HEAT
        RESISTANT PAINTS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Heat-curing
        paints can be used to advantage on the smokebox and
        chimney. These paints, applied from a spray can, are
        cured either by the heat of operation, by blowlamp or by
        baking in the oven. Heating parts coated with this
        material in a very hot oven ( Regulo No. 9 ) for half an
        hour proved satisfactory in the case of Pixie. The black
        finish obtained is midway between eggshell and gloss and
        can be maintained by a light rub with an oily rag. The
        black heat resisting paint in spray cans so beloved of
        motorcycle enthusiasts is great for chimneys, smokeboxes
        and similar items. Oven or gentle heat from a blowlamp
        will cure it to a satisfying matt finish.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When
        painting using spray cans, the can must warmed gently
        before being shaken according to the makers instructions,
        generally for some minutes after the mixing ball is heard
        to rattle within the can. The spray should be tested to
        determine the spray pattern and the distance of the jet
        from the work by trials on a piece of scrap. With both
        cans and guns the spray should be started away to one
        side of the part being coated and carried across the part
        several times before moving away from the workpiece to
        stop the spray. In this way the finish will not be marred
        by blobs of paint which often occur when starting and
        stopping the paint flow. Before succeeding coats are
        applied, (some instructions say that the succeeding coats
        should be applied quite soon, whilst the previous coat is
        tacky even, others require a dry finish before recoating)
        the parts should be turned to ensure that all edges are
        coated. The temptation to build with one coat of spray
        has to be resisted. A series of thin coats always gives
        the best results. Building should be done in the course
        of a series of coats, rubbing down between each coat. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When
        using an airbrush much better control of the paint and
        thus regulation of the coating is possible, the most
        critical aspect here being the cleanliness of the
        equipment. Paint consistency is important and it is
        advisable to strain all but the freshest paints. Mix the
        paint by stirring, not by shaking the can. Always test
        the consistency of the paint on a piece of scrap before
        coating any model parts. Most paints also benefit from
        straining after mixing, strainer material can be obtained
        from model or automotive spares suppliers. When deciding
        on the correct mix of thinner and paint, start on a piece
        of scrap with a 30 - 50 percent thinner content, adding
        more until the flow is correct. A short blow of air alone
        will clear the brush if it clogs. Always clean the
        airbrush using thinners immediately on finishing
        painting, any minute flake of paint that dries on the
        tool could spoil the next job to be tackled. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">During
        the coating process the air brush should be kept on the
        move, using a motion of the hand and arm which maintains
        the head at a constant distance from the surface and
        sweeps the piece with spray. Movement of the wrist varies
        this distance and prevents even coating. Spraying should
        be started and stopped away from the piece being coated.
        Runs and pools of paint result when the brush is
        stationary for even a second. When paint dries too
        quickly, before reaching the part being coated, a rough
        texture develops. Ideally the coat should appear to shine
        as it is applied, rapidly drying as the spray is moved
        on. </font></p>

        things by wiping with a cloth. This action can result in
        the removal of the current coat of paint and parts of the
        previous coats which have become softened by the spray.
        The components should be set aside for the paint to
        harden completely then the surface can be cut back with
        successive strengths of wet and dry paper, care being
        taken not to expose primer at edges and corners. Once a

        this was the first 5 &quot; gauge locomotive built by the
        author it became necessary to build a test track. This
        would later be extended to provide a running facility.
        Material costs were of course a major consideration and

        recycled ! The track would prove expensive if an attempt
        were made to replicate narrow gauge practice, for example
        using 4' 6&quot; Sleepers of 9&quot; x 4&quot; section at
        3' 0&quot; centres as described on the Ffestiniog Railway
        of yore. Some more simple trackage was envisaged,
        probably having randomly spaced sleepers as are sometimes
        encountered. The solution came in the form of discarded
        pallets which are fabricated from anonymous timbers and
        occasionally hardwoods. A kind friend, who is keen on
        woodworking, ripped down enough of the pallet staves to
        the appropriate section which were cut to length prior to
        slotting. The 1 &quot; x 3 / 8&quot; mild steel section
        used for rails was purchased from a commercial supplier
        in 6' 0&quot;lengths. Joints at 6' centres have not
        proved to present a running problem provided that they
        are properly aligned at the time of tightening the
        fishplate bolts. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        three pieces of equipment on the side of the workshop
        allocated to drilling and milling operations provide a
        useful bed for supporting lengthy stock. The drilling
        machine tables can be set level with that of the milling
        machine and long stock thus supported at three points in
        its length. After being brought to a nett 6' length, the
        rails were drilled for fishplate bolts in a jig set on
        the table of the drilling machine. . The jig consisted of
        a pre-prepared fishplate of 1&quot;x 1 / 4&quot; material
        fitted with a stop to accurately position the rail end,
        holes were positioned to establish the location of a
        pilot hole drilled using a centre bitt. Clearances were
        kept to a minimum for 2 B.A. bolts, this resulted in a
        tight joint. With holes centrally positioned in the
        height of the rail the heads of the bolts do not
        interfere with the wheel flanges in service. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Initially
        a few trial sleepers were slotted on the milling machine
        to establish the correct depth of slot and to prove the
        rigidity of the simple sleepering arrangement. Araldite
        was employed to bond the sleepers and rail and it was
        found that sleepers spaced at a maximum of 8 inch centres
        provided a suitably rigid assembly. Latterly the sleepers
        have been secured in place by self-tapping screws from
        below a somwhat tedious job but aided by fences to
        position the drill in the press central in the rail. the
        sleeers being positioned laterally by eye.The remainder
        of the sleepers were slotted in a jig set up on a
        sawbench, the cut being made with a wobble saw. This was
        to be a simple straight track and eight 6' 0&quot;
        lengths were fabricated and used in the early stages of
        testing. Subsequently a curved section of track has been
        built using the same techniques and has performed
        satisfactorily. For this the rail section was taken to a
        local works and put through their rolls. When not in use
        the track is stored on top of a cupboard in the utility
        room and causes no offence to the domestic authority .
        The track described can be laid onto a flat path, or onto
        gravel along a level patch or trench in the garden.
        Should the powers-that-be demand that the track be
        removed and stored between uses this can be simply
        accomplished by means of simple trestles, ladder type
        arrangements of 75 x 50mm timbers which form the supports
        for the sleepers. In their turn, short lengths of fence
        post set into the metal brackets supplied for fencing
        purposes can be cut and provided with cross members to
        support the ladder frames. When the track and ladder
        frames are stored, along the wall inside the garage, hung
        under the eaves of the garage or in a convenient shed the
        posts can be removed and, provided the tops of the
        sockets are set below ground level the grass can be mowed
        as if the railway line never existed. Such an arrangement
        would surely satisfy the most demanding indoor authority!

        SIMPLE DRIVING TROLLEY </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Most
        of us, with the exception of the ride-on 7 1 / 4&quot;
        brigade, will at some time have to build a driving truck.
        Clubmen have access to club vehicles, but the lone model
        engineer with a few yards of track in the garden has to
        have a vehicle from which to drive his pride and joy.
        Having completed Pixie and run it on air on a short
        length of track a few times the writer looked around for
        inspiration. Whilst it was intended that the chosen
        vehicle should convey the spirit of narrow gauge working,
        what was needed was something simple and relatively quick
        to build, ( this a major consideration in view of the
        length of Pixies gestation period ) </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        vehicle which became the final choice was found in one of
        two volumes of a book on the bookshelf, the excellent
        history, ' The Festiniog Railway ' by J. I. C. Boyd,
        published by The Oakwood Press. The open mineral wagon
        illustrated therein would be straightforward to build,
        the wheelbase being such as to permit, with a little
        licence, manufacture of a near scale vehicle which,
        whilst not looking out of place behind Pixie, would offer
        a comfortable driving position. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        the time of completing the locomotive, with driving in
        mind, a special driving back and roof were built with
        openings to improve the view of the gauges and allow
        access to the regulator and brake, Between steamings,
        when the loco is on show these are replaced by nearer
        scale components. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">DRIVING
        POSITION AND ACCESS TO CONTROLS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        commencing design of the truck, a mock-up was built in
        Dexion angle, this was perched on wooden blocks
        representing the wheels. Set-up behind the locomotive
        this proved the projected sitting position to be
        comfortable. It established that the intended design
        would be stable axially, with drivers ' mass ' imposed
        upon the driving seat positioned relative to the proposed
        wheel centres. Transverse stability was also checked to
        avoid sideways rock on the proposed track. The mock-up
        also avoided what would have been a major blunder,
        production of a vehicle which, whilst looking right
        would, due to its height, have allowed only limited
        access for driving and firing the little locomotive. A
        reduction in the height of just the front of the wagon
        was found to be necessary to permit good access to the
        firehole door. The space in front of the drivers seat
        provides useful storage for spare coal, tools and so on. </font></p>

        MATERIALS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Construction,
        apart from the wheel blanks bought at Kennions, Hertford,
        now defunct but who provided excellent service over the
        past 20 years, is from scrap materials gleaned from
        rubbish skips. The main frame materials were part of a
        discarded steel door form, the roller bearings came from
        worn-out washing machines, courtesy of the service
        engineer. Whilst these bearings are not in good enough
        condition for the high speed, arduous requirements of
        washing machine at ' full chat ' they are quite
        satisfactory at the speeds encountered in the model
        application. The footrest is from gas barrel. Plywood and
        framing timber are from kitchen cabinets which were
        replaced and dismantled 20 years ago! The timber is
        superb, clear pine, the likes of which one would be hard
        pressed to find even in specialist timber yards today,
        let alone todays ridiculously pricey Do-It-Yourself
        stores. A weather eye maintained on rubbish skips about
        the town, such a source, particularly where shopfitters
        are working is likely to yield just the stuff our hobby
        calls for ! Rexine and foam for the luxurious upholstered
        seat are from a dearly departed lounge suite. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">BUILDING
        THE TRUCK </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        frames which are over-scale and extremely robust are
        constructed as are frames for most locomotives. They are
        joined using mild steel angle and bolts, great care being
        taken to maintain the whole assembly in truth. Slots were
        provided in the frames for the substantial axle
        assemblies. This allows the complete assembly of
        bearings, bearing housings and wheels, whilst bonded up
        solid onto the axles, to be dropped out in the event of a
        need for maintenance at a later date. In service the
        absence of any form of springing has been found
        acceptable and the vehicle runs freely, reducing the work
        that the locomotive has to do to a minimum. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        wheel blanks were turned on the mandrel previously used
        in producing the locomotive wheels. Axles were turned
        between centres to ensure concentricity, a separate
        bearing being set into the back of one of each pair of
        wheels to overcome differential rates of rotation on
        tight curves. We are talking narrow gauge here! A variety
        of bushes were needed to allow for the assortment of
        sizes of available, ( inexpensive! ) bearings, four of
        which were built into simple, turned housings bolted into
        the slots in the frames. Bonding fluid is used throughout
        to secure axles, bushes and bearings. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        bodywork was mounted onto timber bearers bolted to the
        main frames, the edges of the 5 / 16&quot; plywood being
        built-up to the scale thickness of the timbers of the
        prototype. The lines of individual planks were scribed
        into the ply in accordance with the drawings thoughtfully
        included in the history book. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">1
        1 / 4&quot; and 1 / 2&quot; x 1 / 8&quot; strapping was
        applied to the sides and one end. Whilst these items are
        somewhat overscale, the extra thickness seems to add
        character. For the same reason dummy coach-screw heads
        turned from 3 / 16&quot; square bar were Araldited to the
        strapping, square heads were chosen as looking ' more
        interesting ' than would the bolt heads of the original.
        A ' liberty ' perhaps, but one of those little bits of
        licence that the near-scale modeller can allow himself
        from time to time ! Rudimentary strapping is included at
        the back end to convey the ' atmosphere ' of the hinged
        parts of original vehicle. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Painting
        was carried out using automotive paint in ozone friendly
        dispensers, expensive in themselves but economic in view
        of the availability of appropriate colours in the small
        quantities required. An added bonus obtained by using
        spray-cans is the reduction in clean-up time after the
        painting operation. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Coupling
        to the locomotive is by rigid bar using the scale
        coupling block on the loco and a fabricated coupler on
        the trolley. A heavy duty spring slipped over the
        coupling bar prevents snatch due to take-up in the
        clearance holes in couplings and coupling bar as the
        locomotive moves away, reduces rattle and acts as a
        buffer when the amachine is brought to a halt. </font></p>

        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Driving
        truck braking, should it prove necessary, will be
        achieved by disc braking, not the complex automotive type
        of disc brake but a simple lever operated vee-d block
        working upon a tapered disc or discs, clamped round and
        pinned to the axles, between the frames. These discs can
        be retrofitted using the technique employed in installing
        the axle pump onto Pixies front axle. </font></p>

        FINISHED TRUCK </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        finished result is quite pleasing in appearance,
        comfortable to ride and economic to produce. Nett cost
        was in the region of about Fifteen Pounds thanks to the
        recovered and re-cycled materials employed! The 18 hours
        of construction time provided a pleasant change from the
        more exacting work of modelling the locomotive. The next
        project is the construction of ride-in wagons for
        passengers, these will be based upon other prototypes as
        illustrated in 'The Festiniog Railway'. The search for
        materials has begun ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">HANDLING
        EQUIPMENT </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Even
        a small, narrow gauge locomotive on 5 1 / 2&quot; gauge
        track will prove to be quite weighty. Pixie weighs some
        120 lbs dry, that is with the boiler empty and without
        coal in the bunkers. A model of this weight and
        proportions is literally ' quite a handful ' Thought has
        to be applied to handling the locomotive in the workshop
        and at the track. For the workshop where routine
        servicing is carried on, a hoist was built from standard
        box-section steel, the material came from...yes, a skip!
        A local builders merchants was discarding racking and
        enquiries of the manager brought forth permission to
        acquire the material. Whilst this was a stroke of luck,
        similar section can often be found at the local scrapyard
        or, as a last resort, at a steel stockists. The material
        has good mechanical properties and can be simply sawn and
        bolted or welded. Where bolting is employed care must be
        taken to sleeve bolts within the section using fitted
        lengths of thickwall tube to ensure that they can be
        properly tightened without the section becoming
        distorted. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        proportions of the hoist frame to the base were decided
        by the requirements of stability, also the fact that the
        equipment was to be used on ground which whilst paved was
        not level throughout. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        hoist for Pixie is of welded construction, gussets being
        placed to stiffen the whole assembly, although with a
        good fillet of weld the whole frame works up sufficiently
        rigidly to provide a safe lift. The lifting tackle is
        typical of that available from the local automotive parts
        stockist being intended for handling car parts, and is
        fitted with a positive ratchet control over the lifting
        and the lowering actions. Heavy duty castors were bolted
        to the bottom fork frame which is of such width that it
        can be rolled through a 2' 6&quot; door opening. Where
        castors are used it has to be remembered that with the
        wheels swivelled towards each other, inwards, the true
        base width of the assembly can be very much reduced. In
        the case of large wheels on a narrow base this may reduce
        the actual base size to the point of instability </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        hoist is used to transfer the loco from the bench to a
        trolley and vice versa, the trolley is constructed from
        Dexion angle and has two wheels on an axle placed
        centrally on the frame also a single fixed trailing
        wheel, actually a bearing from some long departed piece
        of machinery. The assembly is similar to that of the
        trolley used to move upright pianos. Pixie is immobilised
        upon the length of track secured to this trolley by some
        removable chocks sitting on the rails. The wheel
        configuration of the trolley provides absolute
        maneuverability through doorways and up and down some
        portable ramps constructed from plywood and the trolley
        can be turned in its own length. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SPREADER
        BAR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As
        in full size practice the lifting connection between
        locomotive and hoist is by spreader bar. This is
        fabricated from box section with lifting points welded
        into position. These ensure that the locomotive is
        correctly balanced in the course of a lift. Where more
        that one locomotive is to be handled using the same
        equipment the lifting loop positions can be made
        adjustable as long as positive location is provided
        against longitudinal movement. Only good quality slings
        are used, these are made from climbing rope of guaranteed
        tensile strength, purchased from the local yacht
        chandlers. In the short lengths required this rope offers
        very good value. The knotted ends of the slings are
        prevented from unraveling by a touch of the blowlamp, not
        sufficient to burn, but sufficient to melt the rope and
        allow it to be rolled to a smooth finish. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TESTING
        THE EQUIPMENT </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Although
        such equipment may be intended for the sole use of the
        owner, and probably will only be used in the workshop and
        on private ground away from the public, it is recommended
        that the equipment is tested. A test should be carried
        out by a full lift, throughout the range of the gear, of
        twice the maximum weight intended to be lifted in
        practice. Bags of cement or shingle provide suitable
        loads of known weight for the test. The safe working load
        ( SWL ) thus established should be indicated on the frame
        and the spreader bar. At no time should anyone be allowed
        under a suspended load, except where some trestle or
        benchwork is arranged in such a manner as to prevent the
        load from dropping in the event of failure. It is unwise
        and dangerous to attempt to move such a frame under load
        on bad or uneven ground. </font></p>

        having a blade in place of the point. My firing shovel is
        fashioned from a serving spoon, part of the ' family
        silver' , with the end ground square and the sides turned
        up. It just enters the firehole door and the handle is
        just long enough to stay cool. One day it will be treated
        to a wooden handle ! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">TWO
        SIMPLE BLOWERS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When
        it comes to steaming the loco almost essential as the
        supply of coal and water, is a blower. Having a small
        compressor in the workshop it seemed sense to make up an
        air powered blower. The principal is described in LBSC's
        book on ' Tich '. A small tube blows air up a larger
        diameter tube which fits into the locomotive chimney
        causing the vacuum necessary to draw the fire. The outer
        tube in the assembly devised for Pixie comprises a length
        of large diameter copper water pipe and a parallel union.
        The union has a groove turned around the periphery into
        which is fitted an ' O ' ring to ensure a push fit in the
        chimney and importantly an airtight joint. The small
        angled tube, which is silver-soldered into the main body
        about 1 inch above the level of the chimney cap, is
        swaged to a point then drilled using a No 70 bitt. The
        supply end of the small tube is fitted with a Schraeder
        valve, acquired from a local tyre fitting shop ( collect
        a handful whilst you are there, they come in for lots of
        things about the workshop ). The valve permits coupling
        to the inflator accessory of the compressor. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        use the main tube is inserted into the chimney where it
        stands firmly fixed by the friction provided by the ' O '
        ring. The tyre inflator is attached to the schraeder
        valve and the blower is ready for action. An advantage of
        the air powered blower is that the draught obtained is
        infinitely variable according to the amount of air
        allowed to flow through the inflator valve. In practice
        only a very small blast is required. Too strong a blast
        makes a hole in the fire and causes embers to clog the
        tubes. Once the correct draught has been established, a
        small block of wood wired to the handle of the inflator
        helps maintain the setting by limiting the trigger
        travel. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        novel blower for use whether or not a power source is
        available was illustrated in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 156, No.
        3778. 6-19 June 1986. The blower built by Maurice Simmons
        was based upon a traditional bicycle lamp case. A disc of
        metal replaced the glass and provided support for a low
        voltage motor and three small diameter struts supporting
        a further plate which served as a bearing for the
        impeller fan. In use, a tube mounted on a further plate
        below the fan, fitted into the chimney of the locomotive.
        Mr Simmons replaced the battery in the body of the lamp
        with a pack containing two re-chargeable batteries for
        economy. Any model engineer worth his salt would be able
        to build a similar device quickly and cheaply. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">OILING
        ROUND AND FILLING UP </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Check
        that the mechanical lubricator is filled, work the manual
        wheel or lever a few times to free the clack, go right
        round the locomotive with the oil can, oiling bearings,
        rods, eccentrics and so on, plus fill all oil cups. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Check
        that the blowndown valve(s) are closed, then open the
        whistle valve or some other vent to allow air to escape
        as the boiler is filled with water. Water can be
        introduced either through the safety valve bush from an
        external supply, a bottle or can, or from the tank using
        the hand pump. The latter method will be quite a slow job
        although it will prove the efficiency of the pump, and
        the tightness of the unions in the feedwater system.
        Filling through the safety valve bush, or better still
        through a bush provided for the purpose on the steam
        dome, can be speeded-up using a plastic bottle fitted
        with a small diameter plastic tube, the plastic bottle
        being squeezed to introduce an element of force feeding!
        For the more ' laid back ' a can of water set on top of
        the cab can be used to feed water siphoned through a
        small bore tube. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        water level should be checked in the gauge glass. You are
        aiming for about 3 / 4 of a glass. It makes sense at this
        stage to open the water gauge drain valve. As the drain
        tube is of small diameter the water rises slowly in the
        glass despite the small quantity draining away. Once the
        correct level shows in the glass the valve can be closed,
        the safety valve or the filler plug inserted, and
        whatever is used as a vent, closed. The saddle tank can
        next be filled. With both the boiler and the water tank
        filled, refill the water containers, this will avoid a
        panic situation when the onboard water supply gets low
        after some time in steam ! </font></p>

        blower will fan the sticks into flame. After a while,
        when they settle to a red glow, put in a few shovel fulls
        of coal. Close the door and after a few minutes further
        blowing when the whole fire will be glowing red, add more
        coal. Soon the air blower can be removed and the
        locomotives own blower set to work. The pressure gauge
        will start to register and continued firing will bring
        the pressure to working level and the safety valves will
        start to lift. Watch the water level, pumping by hand as
        required, not too much however. </font></p>

        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As
        the beginner soon finds out, firing and driving a
        locomotive, albeit a model locomotive does not come easy.
        One has to learn how to best use the controls to maintain
        a head of steam, and more importantly what to do if the
        pressure falls off. It is exciting, and even though the
        first few firings may prove disappointing as far as
        performance is concerned a lot will be learned and a
        great sympathy develops for the engine men of the steam
        era who drove through whatever weather and conditions
        prevailed, rain, snow, ice and sometimes even, flood.
        These men ( heros ) took great pride in their work and in
        their time keeping. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Spare
        a thought for the engine men of the Festiniog Railway of
        1876. The Railway Regulations of the day set out a series
        of fines which were to be levied on unfortunate workers
        as follows:- </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">'Engine
        driver for having used greater quantity of Coal or Oil

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">THESE
        RULES to be strictly enforced: none but the most tangible

        UNDER WAY </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Having
        built the fire to an all-over incandescence, and topped
        up with a layer of fresh coal. it is time to start! With
        the reversing lever in full forward gear and with
        cylinder drain valves open, open the regulator slightly
        whilst easing the loco forward a few feet. Steam will
        drive out any water from the cylinders as well as
        beginning to heat the pistons and cylinders. During this
        process the locomotive will be blowing off and using
        steam so it is essential to watch the gauge glass and
        pump up as necessary. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There
        may be a shower of water from the chimney at this stage
        as the condensate is blown past the slide valve, this
        will soon cease however and the whole show will settle
        down ! Close the the drain valves soon as the cylinders
        are clear and steam alone is issuing from them. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        setting of the safety valves should be checked against
        the pressure gauge which will have been calibrated
        against a full size gauge in the workshop. Have the
        necessary tools to hand at firing-up time. In the case of
        there being two valves fitted, they both should be set to
        blow at the same pressure. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Now
        is the time to set the reversing lever to full forward
        gear, open the regulator gently, avoiding wheel slip,
        close the blower down and feel the locomotive surge
        forward, as surely it will. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Once
        under way adjust the gear back a notch or so, and enjoy! </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst
        driving there a lot of things to be remembered :- </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Two
        of the driver / fireman's actions result in loss of
        boiler pressure, those of adding coal to the fire, and
        adding water to the boiler. These actions should be
        carried out when the safety valves are blowing . Always
        shut the blower down after opening the regulator. In
        motion the exhaust is sufficiently strong to draw the
        fire. Open the blower valve before closing the regulator
        in order to maintain the draught. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Adjust
        the by-pass valve to maintain the water level in the
        gauge glass, remember that the axle driven pump works
        flat-out all the time, and with both pumps working one
        can soon be in for a shower! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Fire
        little and often to maintain an incandescent fire whilst
        avoiding a drop in steam pressure. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        few droplets of oil around the chimney top are a good
        sign that oil is getting through the system </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Make
        sure to add coal to the front of the fire, use a pricker
        if necessary to distribute the coal and avoid a choked
        grate. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">On
        an ' out and back track ' add coal when the locomotive is
        stationary and when the safety valves blow, its too late
        when the fire blackens. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        layer of coal on an incandescent fire will light and
        burn, on a black or holey fire it will not. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It
        is not necessary to keep the fire up to the level of the
        firehole door, this is wasteful and leads to a choked
        fire. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">If
        the fire does die down, avoid pumping cold water into the
        boiler, use the blower in short bursts or make the loco
        work harder, by putting the reversing lever into full
        forward gear, until the fire comes back. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        the event that the pressure continues to fall off it will
        be necessary to open the blower to increase the draught
        and draw the fire, this is also necessary at the stops
        and at the end of an out and back track. In the latter
        circumstances it is all too easy to forget to close the
        blower valve so be alert and avoid a holey fire! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Notching-up,
        shortening the cut-off by moving the reversing lever
        nearer to mid-gear, saves steam and thus coal and water. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">If
        on any of the first few runs things appear to be '
        getting ' out of hand, do not hesitate to pull the pins
        and drop the fire. Better safe than sorry is a good motto
        where the pressures encountered with model locomotives
        are concerned. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SHUTTING
        DOWN </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        sequence of shutting down after steaming is equally
        important as that of firing up the loco. The fire should
        be allowed to burn right down as far as possible whilst
        retaining sufficient pressure to a permit blowing down.
        The blowdown valve ( s ) should be fully opened to permit
        the sediment that collects about the foundation ring to
        be ejected. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        firegrate and ashpan can be dropped, and the firebox
        brushed out. With the smokebox door open and the ash
        cleared, a blowthrough with compressed air will clear
        away any debris from the tubes. Later tube brushes will
        finish of the task. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">All
        valves should be left open and the warmth of the boiler
        will dry all out. It is best to leave the valves open
        whilst the locomotive is in store, particularly the
        regulator. Martin Evans, in ' Rob Roy, Building a
        Caledonian 0 - 6 - 0 Tank locomotive ' Argus Books
        Limited., passes on the helpful tip that ' should a
        regulator or blower valves stick in storage, rather than
        attempt to force them open, it is better to raise steam
        when they will almost certainly free themselves with very
        little persuasion ' </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At
        this stage the engine drivers friend, the oily rag passed
        over the paint work will promote that silky, satiny
        finish so beloved of the railway enthusiast. WD 40 or
        similar lubricant in suspension will protect the working
        parts and can be cleaned off using a rag dipped in
        methylated spirit prior to the next run. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This
        is a good time to check the locomotive over, tightening
        any loosened fastenings, replacing lost pins, caps or
        corks and generally putting things in order so that the
        next steam-up can be started without hold-ups. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Although
        excellent models can be produced with the bare minimum of
        equipment there are certain tools and attachments that
        can be readily fabricated from scrap. The following have
        proved useful in general model engineering work in fact,
        without them some parts would have been difficult to
        produce. The attachments for the Myford noted here can be
        made from offcuts, or at least from relatively cheap
        materials found in the odds-and-ends bin at the material
        suppliers. Whilst the time expended in making them has to
        be set aside from model making the results will prove
        useful in constructing the present and many future
        models. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">REAR
        TOOL HOLDER </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        most useful attachment made to date is the rear toolpost
        used for parting-off. This was machined from two blocks
        of mild steel, fixed together using socket-head screws.
        This assembly was then drilled and bored for a clamping
        bolt passed from the top through into a length of tee nut
        which fits into any of the slots in the topslide. The
        clamping bolt is fitted with a lever terminating in a
        ball handle. The parting tool holder is located, upside
        down of course, within the toolpost using two further
        socket head screws. Use of the rear tool post removes the
        possibility of dig-ins and jamming. This attachment has
        transformed parting-off from a chore to a pleasure, and
        all for minimal cost. Used on the front of the top slide
        it can be used for holding the more substantial boring
        tools although due to the constant need for a parting-off
        tool in practice, a further similar tool holder has been
        produced for this purpose. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">FLY
        CUTTING ATTACHMENTS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        very simple device for use in fly cutting can be made
        from a length of bar drilled to accept cutters, secured
        by grub screws. This can be set in the four-jaw chuck and
        adjusted as necessary by moving the bar within the jaws.
        Material to be machined is clamped on the saddle or
        mounted on the vertical slide. For the milling machine a
        tool holder has been fabricated from a billet of steel
        obtained from the local scrap yard. This is turned to
        register with the backplate on the quill of the milling
        machine and is secured by Allen cap head screws in
        counterbored holes. The cutters, from silver steel rod,
        are adjusted and secured by grubscrews. In service, in
        the light milling machine, the mass of the block provides
        a ' flywheel ' effect and also reduces vibration when
        intermittent cuts are made. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        BORING TOOL HOLDER AND ARBOUR </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Boring
        small and deep holes can be carried out using a simple
        attachment based upon a design illustrated in MODEL
        ENGINEER. The body of the attachment is a block of mild
        steel, cleaned up all round and trued on top and bottom
        faces by turning in the four jaw chuck. The block is
        drilled and reamed to match the tool clamp stud on the
        topslide of the lathe. This completed the block is
        secured on the topslide in place of the tool clamp
        assembly ready for drilling and boring for a silver steel
        bar of 1 / 2 inch diameter which forms the tool holder.
        The hole for the tool arbour is drilled and reamed from
        the headstock drill chuck, feed being achieved by
        advancing the saddle. If required, the tailstock can be
        brought up to the back of the block to provide additional
        support during these operations. With the hole completed
        the block is drilled and tapped for two socket headed
        screws then slotted to form a clamp which secures the
        tool arbour in service. The arbour is turned down and
        threaded with a fine thread to accept the coned cap. The
        cap is cross drilled for the tool, coned, then tapped to
        suit the thread on the bar, it is provided with a knurled
        grip for first adjustment and two flats which permit the
        use of spanners in tightening the the thread to grip the
        tool. A small slug of phosphor bronze acts as a bearing
        between the thread end and the tool. Suitable cutters may

        will suffice ) </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In
        use, with block set up on the topslide clamp stud and the
        arbour gripped in the block, the toolsteel is set into
        the coned head and a spanner used to tighten the grip.
        With the clamp eased, the arbour can then be rotated to
        bring the cutting tool to true centre height. The
        clamping screws are then tightened. The bar can now lined
        up in the hole to be bored and the lathe clamping stud
        tightened. Depth of cut within the bore is adjusted by
        the cross slide feed screw. </font></p>

        BOLTS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Several
        clamping bolts have been made up. These are from silver
        steel and match the threads in the Myford tee-slot nuts
        and also the closer disk for the crosslide anchor plate.
        Apart from normal duty retaining the various tool holders
        and the Verdict gauge stand, they can be used, in
        conjunction with suitable drilled and slotted plates to
        secure work in course of milling, fly-cutting and so on. </font></p>

        SIMPLE DIVIDING ATTACHMENT </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        lathe attachment which is very simple to construct is a
        dividing attachment to engage in the bull ring. This is
        in constant use, in preparation of bolts, nuts, in
        setting out holes on cylinder covers and operations such
        as filing carried out in the lathe. The attachment
        comprises a plate bracket which, attached to the
        headstock casing using a bolt through the existing hole,
        supports a spring-loaded plunger engaging in the
        bullwheel of the backgear assembly. Using the attachment
        the headstock spindle can be locked in any one of 60
        positions and of course multiples of those positions,
        providing divisions of 60, 30, 20, 15, 10, 6, 4, 3, and
        2. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        simple modification, cutting the detent tongue to match
        the profile of the bull ring teeth increases the
        divisions that can be achieved. In this role the detent
        tongue is rotated through 90 degrees to pick up a further
        60 positions. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">GAUGE
        BLOCKS </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Over
        the years, whenever offcuts of steel have come to hand,
        these have been checked out for size, marked accordingly
        and set aside for use as gauge pieces. One
        straightforward use for such pieces is in setting the
        saddle from a saddle stop. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">SADDLE
        STOP </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This
        comprises a length of 1/4 inch diameter bar sliding
        within two lugs. The lugs are secured to a backplate
        attached to the headstock of the lathe, using bolts into
        the tapped holes provided for gearbox fixing. Length of
        travel is limited using a bolt through a small collar
        sliding within the lugs. In use the tool is run to its
        intended eventual position relative to the headstock, a
        shoulder or thread end. the rod is brought up to contact
        the edge of the lathe carriage, the collar is slid to
        contact the rearmost lug, that furthest from the
        tailstock end, and locked into position. The projecting
        rod thus governs the travel of the saddle. To set a
        specific length of cut the cutting edge of the tool is
        brought to the end of the workpiece, one of the gauge
        pieces, or a drill shank matching the required length of
        cut is placed between the stop and the saddle and the
        bush secured against the backstop. Turning can then
        commence confident in the knowledge that the saddle stop
        will determine the correct length of cut. If auto feed is
        engaged the leadscrew nut should be disengaged a short
        distance from the stop and the cut completed manually.
        The little gadget is invaluable when turning to a
        shoulder and where putting a set length of thread onto a
        rod held in the chuck. </font></p>

        FOUR-WAY TOOLPOST </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        four-way toolpost was constructed completely from scrap.
        A piece of round mild steel was turned to replicate the
        Myford closer disk for the topslide anchor plate and
        provide the fixing to the lathe carriage. Three blanks of
        mild steel were cut to size and squared-up in the four
        jaw chuck to form the main body of the attachment. The
        height of the lower block of the three is sized, relative
        to the centre height of the lathe, to permit either
        square shank tools or tools set in the Myford tool boat
        to be used. The three pieces of the body were welded
        together ( socket headed cap screws could have been used
        ) and the whole assembly cleaned-up. The upper plate was
        drilled and tapped for the tool retaining bolts. The
        Myford closer disk and the circular base of the toolpost
        were joined using 1 / 4 inch B.S.F. Cap screws and the
        central hole tapped for the clamping bolt. The clamping
        bolt is a length of 3 / 8 inch silver steel threaded each
        end with a B.S.F thread, the bottom engaging in the base
        plate, the top terminating in a a length of 1 1 / 4 inch
        diameter mild steel into which the spindle for the ball
        handle is inserted. A simple detent comprising an
        externally threaded bush with a plunger actuated by a
        spring was fabricated, again from offcuts of mild steel
        rod ready for insertion into a 1 / 4 inch reamed hole in
        the body. With the body, the base and the clamping screw
        completed the blind holes in the base were drilled by
        spotting through the 1/4 inch hole in the body with the
        toolholder locked in the four required positions. The
        body was then removed from the base and the spotted holes
        were completed in the pillar drill with the stop set to
        avoid breaking-through the plate. </font></p>

        KNURLING TOOL </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        knurling tool was fabricated to details published in Ian
        Bradleys book 'The amateurs workshop'. This is a tool
        described as a straddle turning tool, comprising a body
        supporting a yoke retaining two arms, each fitted with a
        commercially obtainable knurling wheel. The advantage of
        straddle knurling is that, provided the wheels are
        adjusted to be diametrically opposite each other when
        forming the knurl, the forces are contained within the
        tool and not transmitted to the headstock bearings. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        TAPPING GUIDE </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There
        are a large number of tapped holes in the parts of the
        average locomotive, many of which are of the smaller
        sizes, 7 BA, 8 BA and beyond. To ensure the accuracy of
        the threads and avoid tap breakage, time spent in making
        a small tapping tool will be amply rewarded. Any flat
        piece of plate can be used for the baseplate, careful
        filing will provide the necessary accuracy. The head can
        be arranged to slide on pillar, a stock length of silver
        steel of about 1 inch diameter, secured into the base
        with retaining fluid. The head, a block of mild steel has
        two holes which have been drilled and bored in the same
        set-up on the lathe cross slide. One hole is a nice slide
        fit on the pillar, a slot enables this to be locked into
        position by two cap screws. A length of 1 / 2inch
        diameter bar is set into the other hole, one end prepared
        to accept whatever chuck is available, the other a
        knurled head. In service it is helpful if the head is
        cross-drilled for a tommy-bar. It is advisable that if a
        thread is used for mounting the chuck it is screwcut on
        the lathe to ensure concentricity. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        UNIVERSAL CHUCK MOUNT </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        chuck mount is a useful attachment which permits work to
        be set up away from the lathe. Some second operations can
        also be carried out on, for example, the milling or
        drilling machine. Either the four jaw, or the three jaw
        chuck can be accomodated and mounted on ancilliary
        equipment such as the vertical table or a rotary table.
        The basis of the attachment is a standard accessory, a
        Number 2 Morse taper spindle. this is mounted in the
        three jaw and the tapered spindle parted off just behind
        the register. for the chuck. The back of this piece
        should be lightly relieved to ensure that it beds down
        fully on the baseplate at the time of assembly. These
        operations are easy as the material used is extremely
        free cutting. ( The tapered spindle can be set aside and
        used for another purpose such as a screw support for use
        when working on slender discs in either type of chuck )
        The threaded portion is then drilled and tapped for two
        1/4 inch cap screws which will be used to secure it to a
        base plate. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The
        base plate can be from any piece of plate of reasonable
        thickness. Ideally it should be of sufficient size to
        permit of picking up the tee slots in the equipment to
        which it will be attached, yet small enough to be used on
        the available surface plate whilst leaving room for the
        base of a height gauge to be moved about whilst marking
        out. The plate should be squared-up and turned, or fly
        cut, to uniform thickness throughout before drilling for
        the tee bolts and the two cap screws for fixing the nose
        piece. The holes for the cap screws should be
        counterbored and the attachment can then be assembled. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Whilst
        lathe chucks can be mounted on the finished attachment
        for a variety of operations, heavy milling cuts should be
        avoided as they could loosen the chuck on the mounting
        with dire results! It is also essential to remember when
        using the mount to cut in such a direction that the tool
        attempts to ' climb ' </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A
        SIMPLE 'WOBBLER' </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This
        device is based upon an article in MODEL ENGINEER Vol
        159, No 3811 October 1987 by Mr Cruikshank. The wobbler
        comprises a length of 2mm diameter rod with pointed ends,
        floating in a rubber bearing (cut from a car tyre tread),
        projecting through a 1 / 8 inch hole at centre height
        within a short length of mild steel bar. Any small
        eccentricity at the pointed end in contact with the part
        to be set is reflected by a greater movement at the free
        end. The ratio of the lengths of the two arms of the rod
        about the bush determine the amount of movement of the
        indicator end and a ratio of 6 : 1 seems to be about
        right for most purposes. In use the pointed end of the
        rod is located into a centre pop mark on the piece to be
        set and the chuck jaws are adjusted until the movement of
        the free end is minimised. When this stage is reached the
        piece is properly centred. </font></p>
