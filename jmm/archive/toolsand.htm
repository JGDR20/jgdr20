        setting up the pages ' <em>Building the Allchin</em> ' I
        mentioned that, once one has a lathe and, posiblly a
        light mill or substantial drill , apart from the jigs and
        templates required for a particular project there are a
        number of useful bits of equipment that can be
        constructed, often from scrap'.</font></p>

        article can cost much less. yet meet the basic

        the block of barstock to the mill. Scrap steel was used

    the small block of metal, twice slotted, three times drilled,
    twice tapped and once bored hold a boring bar which
    accommodates short cutters from tool steel. it proved useful
    a number of times in constructing both<em> Pixie </em>and the
    <em>Allchin. </em>On the right, salvaged steel used to
    construct a rear toolpost. If anything revolutionises
    parting-off it is the rear toolpost, particularly for the
    amateur. In the event of ' An issue ' as problems are termed
    today. a jamb, or a dig-in the tool tends to lift slightly
    and further damage can be avoided. both items were made for
    the cost of the knobs, cap screws and some more sweat !</font></p>

    up in the rear tool post cost the price of the knurls and is
    kinder on the lathe than the single knurl model, The right
    hand image shows a bracket for mounting gauges which also
    provides fixing for the ' Wobbler ' possibly the most
    primitive yet effective bit of gear for centering stock in
    the chuck. With the fine point in a deep ' pop ' on the
    workpiece the long end of the pointer magnifies any degree of
    eccentricity. </font></p>
