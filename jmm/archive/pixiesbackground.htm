        <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">The writer's
        decision to model PIXIE the Kerr Stuart ' Wren' Class
        locomotive KS4260 / 1922 was based upon several factors.
        First and foremost was the impression I had on sighting
        the little locomotive as it coasted into Pages Park
        Station on the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway one
        spring afternoon. It seemed incredible that a locomotive,
        produced initially for work on the installation of a
        sewer in 1922, should 60 years later be found running
        like a Rolls-Royce and doing useful work in a domestic
        setting. </font></a></p>
        <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Enquiries revealed
        a little of the history of the locomotive, the fact that
        after the completion of the Barkingside sewer contract it
        had for some years worked in the Wilmington Road Quarry
        of Devon County Council, eventually being purchased by
        the Industrial Locomotive Society and brought to Leighton
        Buzzard in the late 1960's. The locomotive has an overall
        length of something over 10 feet, it weighs 3 Tons 7 cwt
        empty, and 4 tons 3 cwt in working order. The inside
        framed locomotive has Hackworth valve gear and is
        resplendent in attractive livery of black, green and
        gold.</font></a></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Technical">My
        thanks go to The Directors, Managers and Staff of the
        Leighton Buzzard Narrow Guage Railway for the access

    <blockquote>
        <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Here was a
        locomotive that was mechanically quite simple for a
        relative beginner to construct, It would be accessible
        for survey and was in the hands of friendly folk prepared
        to assist with provision of information. The railway was
        within 25 miles of home base, so that the survey could be
        staged over a series of visits. Above all, the locomotive
        had an atmosphere and charm which appeared to the writer
        to convey the very essence of narrow gauge railways. The
        decision has never been regretted and has, over the past
        twenty years, opened up a whole new interest in the
        mechanical engineering of railways and of narrow gauge
        railways in particular. </font></a></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Technical">A</font><a><font
        size="3" face="Technical">t this stage the modeller
        intending to work in narrow gauge has to come to terms
        with the fact that just as much work will be involved in
        producing his chosen model as in producing one to run on
        standard gauge. Pixie was ten years in the building,
        through choice. Some things are too good to hurry and
        although one is always keen to get one's locomotive onto
        the track, later efforts can be savoured, and perhaps
        greater attention paid to detail.</font></a></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Technical">With the exception of
        the boiler, lubricator and gauges everything including
        patterns for the castings was produced from scratch..
        Occasionally where there was only a small difference from
        the scale dimension it was possible to use off- the-shelf
        materials for platework, shafts etc., otherwise sawing,
        milling, turning, filing and polishing were the ' Order
        of the day '</font></p>

        <p><a><font size="3" face="Technical">Although
        construction of a sizeable standard gauge model
        locomotive may make excessive demands on the capacity of
        one's workshop and equipment, narrow gauge locomotives
        are generally simpler in design and, at the same scale,
        work up smaller in model form. ( This fact can be used to
        advantage by the modeller 'moving-up' to a larger scale).
        The flavour of work and operations on a narrow gauge line
        can be replicated within a small workshop and in ones own
        backyard.</font></a></p>

        activities ' along narrow gauge lines' provide every
        opportunity for the incorporation into models of the very
        things that attract us to the prototype, to make and
        handle the artifacts that would otherwise, unless one
        works as a volunteer on a preserved line, be literally
        beyond reach. It should be remembered however that
        modelled on 5&quot; Gauge quite a small locomotive such
        as PIXIE, at some 10 feet overall, will be more than
        25&quot; long in model form and of such dry weight that
        it is beyond one (normal) man's lifting ability! Quite
        apart from the weight of the model the physical size,
        25&quot; long x 11.5&quot; wide by 20&quot; high are
        dimensions to be reckoned with when it comes to handling
        in the workshop and between shop and track! </font></a></p>
