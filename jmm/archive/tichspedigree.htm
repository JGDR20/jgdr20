        <dt><font size="3" face="Technical">Many years ago, the
            magazine <strong>' Model Enginer '</strong> published
            ,over a period of some years, a series of articles by
            a writer using the pen name LBSC ( Taken from that of
            the London, Brigton and South Coast railway ! ) He
            described his writing as ' The words and music '
            These articles and others, all of which have been
            published in plan and book form have introduced
            thousands of us to model locomotive construction.
            These books are readily available
            from...............................</font></dt>
    </dl>
    <p><font size="3" face="Technical">Tich was one of dozens of
    designs by LBSC still being built in amateurs workshops
    worldwide.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Technical">LBSC was a quiet, lonely
    man who came from a poor family and who was thus used to
    improvisation, his articles included practical tips and
    advice such that the veriest beginner with a small lathe and
    some basic metalworking tools could complete a full working
    model steam locomotive !</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Technical">As a concrete specialist,
    with a permanent workshop, a good quality lathe by <strong>Myford</strong>,
    a drill press and newly purchased milling machine, with
    experience gained building a number of stationary engines,
    Tich seemed to present a great project to get me in to
    locomotives.</font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"

<p><font size="3" face="Technical">I will include more images in
the hope that they will assist future builders this will require
a search in the archives. There will be many more builders and
not just on 3 1/2&quot; gauge, I have spotted 5&quot;gauge
versions in various spots around the web, and there may be
larger.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Technical">I work slowly and
intermittently and 400 hours of enjoyable workshop time some 20
years ago resulted in the emergence of my first real live steam
locomotive. It ran fine on compressed air. As with all my models
having once steamed them I clean and polish them for display.
Tich remains unpainted as the brass and stainless steel looks
well. One day he will have a coat of the varnish used by makers
of musical instruments.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Technical"><strong>The results, a
personal view</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Technical">I have to admit that initially
things were not easy ! There were new processes to be learned.
Having constructed several stationary engines, the basics were
there, but now silver soldering and brazing had to be added to
the ' repertoire', also machining techniques which vary, from
metal to metalsuch as cutter speeds and the like.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Technical">Some parts were made and
remade ( There are still some pieces that I would re-remake if
time were not now so valuable ) I learned a great deal from
LBSC's writing and from the interest that developed in
engineering practice.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Technical"><strong>* I
still take pride in my early product but believe that, asked to
advise a newcomer to the hobby on choice of model, I would
suggest a scale model rather than the generic model of an early
0-4-0 that Tich really is. The same lessons willll be learned but
they will finish up ( probably after many more hours workshop
time ) with a more desirable end product. </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Technical">The choice of project has to
be be based upon the equipment available in the workshop. As work
proceeds further tools, drills, taps, dies etc.,can be purchased
as the work demands. Good tools are always a good investment and
properly cared for their value will beat the inflated costs as
the years go by.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Technical">*</font><font size="2"
face="Arial">An Email from Steve White has confirmed thoughts I
hadwhen I completed ' Tich ' as my beginners model. He writes:-<em>
</em></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em>I agree wholeheartedly
    about the choice of Tich as a project, it took 38 years to
    finish mine - I started at 16 ! Now Tich is finished, he/she?
    was finished early this year, the chassis was run on air and
    the valves set, the boiler was hydraulically tested and then
    steamed using a blowlamp in the firebox, all was well. I made
    a log during the time leading up to completion detailing the
    trials, tribulations, house moves, frustrations etc. At
    completion I looked at it and thought that in the same amount
    of time with probably less problems I could have been looking
    at a &quot;Black five&quot; or a &quot;Jinty&quot;. </em></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em>Apart from the small size
    of some of the components, at the final fitting stage the
    whole loco was a giant puzzle requiring a fixed order of
    assembly so that access could be gained to all the parts.
    Many times the whole thing had to be almost dissassembled to
    fit one part and then start again! I am also sure that
    another Tich could be made from the contents of the scrapbox!
    &#133;&#133;..all credit to Curly though. I remember seeing
    on a web site the number of sets of Tich castings that have
    been sold over the years, they ran into tens of thousands.
    Where are they all?</em></font></p>
