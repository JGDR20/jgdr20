        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The Clyde 'puffer '
        photographed in my workshop. The model, one of my fleet
        of assorted craft, was kit built by a friend, an ex-naval
        type. He sailed the boat a few times then it spent 10
        years or so in a cupboard, as did the radio
        transmitter.The Puffer was then gifted to me, gratefully
        received and promptly renovated. The prop shaft had
        seized up, not due to corrosion but to decomposing
        grease, and soon responded to a spot of grease of the
        elbow variety. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">As in each of my boats the
        board speed controller has been replaced with a with a
        BEC,. I took it to the pond a few days later and enjoyed
        an hour or so sailing. It is a great favourite at the
        lake as it looks quaint and sails convincingly, also many
        of the older folk remember it as the vessel that the old
        reprobate ' Para Handy ' skippered in a television series
        of years ago.</font><font size="1" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">My friend got the degree of
        weathering just right. and the little craft looks
        extremely realistic on the water. It is a popular model,
        has a glass fibre hull and the kit came with a large
        number of white metal fittings. Many examples of the boat
        are to be seen on the water and at exhibitions.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">Addition of more portholes than in
        the prototype has provide ventilation for the electronic
        speed controller sited in the engine room</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The boat is a pleasure to sail,
        response to the helm is excellent, with very little heel
        on turns. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">On one occasion a small boy at the
        pondside, possibly not more than 3or 4 years old asked
        for ' A go '. His mother said ' He's got RC Toys at home
        ' I disregarded the ' Toy ' bit and let him try. He did
        it all with ease...............a compliment to the kit
        designer at Caldercraft ! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The excellence was recognised</font><font
        size="2"> </font><font size="3" face="Arial">when the kit
        was awarded a gold medal at the Nuremburg Toy Fair of
        1984, a first for any British kit manufacturer and a
        first for any marine model kit from around the world. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5" face="Arial">Sea Hornet (much modified
        ) </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">This boat was built about
        50 years ago, it cost somewhere about £3 for a first
        rate kit of timber parts, drawing and instructions,</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">The hull is, to my mind, a
        beautiful thing to behold with the flared bows and curved
        tumblehome. For years it was a display model untill the
        radio control bug bit and it was motorised, space made
        for a 6V gel battery ( Just squeezed in ) and a radio
        receiver fitted below the rear hatches. The raised 'Hump'
        was added, with a mental apology to the original
        designer, to provide space and cooling for the electronic
        speed contoller.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I favour gel batteries as they give
        sensible running times, and even this boat in spite of
        the 14 oz weight ( mass ) of the gel battery readily
        climbs into planing mode. For this reason the boat has
        been a great favourite with the younger generation !</font></p>
        <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>The Crash Tender</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Another 'Oldie ' is the
        crash tender again built 50 or more years ago. The boat
        is still a great favourite with model boat enthusiasts
        and has been re-issued in a currently available kit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Money was scarce at that
        time so the fittings were never purchased...one day we
        will get round to it perhaps ! </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="/jgdr20/assets/jmm/crashtender.jpg"
        width="565" height="258"></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Another all-timber kit (
        With a few plastic port frames thrown in...amazing in
        those days of relative austerity! ) The parts assembled
        into a robust model, again a most pleasing hull shape,
        particularly the bows the curves of which were difficult
        to forrm onto relatively thin stringers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">This boat whilst intended
        for glowplug or similar engine is fitted with a 12v motor
        and matching gel battery and performs well following
        assistance from Simon at the Prop Shop. It is robust and
        like the Sea Hornet has sailed on many waters over the
        years.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The camouflage paint job
        was a recent experiment in masking, something that I had
        never attempted before, the appearance will be
        incongruous to the enthusiast but I had the practice,
        gained experience and anyway, it pleases me !</font></p>
