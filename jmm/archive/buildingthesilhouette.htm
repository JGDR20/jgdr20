        the small sailor/cruiser 'Silhouette'</font></p>

        my Father and my Sons.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">On this page I will attempt to
        detail the methods used in constructing this model. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><strong>The
        prototype</strong> was a 'Silhouette ' class boat built
        in wood. It was the forerunner of a large number of
        similar boats built in fibreglass. At 17'6&quot; with a
        small cabin and a reasonably sized well it gave us all
        the pleasure of a larger boat economically and being a
        bilge keel boat was simple enough to transport ( on a
        very rudimentary trailer, no brakes even !) The shallow
        draught made it easy to launch</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">In the absence of
        drawings start was made by studying old 35mm photographic
        slides . Fortunately as well as the boat the images
        showed people, this aided with scaling. The decision was
        made to build a 1/12th model for display, or possibly
        later to sail with radio control installed.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">As usual, where
        possible, materials would come from scrap and recovered
        materials. For example, </font><font size="3"
        face="Arial">a building board was fabricated from offcuts
        of laminated flooring, two pieces being screwed together
        on a plane surface to provide an accurate work surface..</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">PVA adhesive is used
        throughout as, when the model is completed, several coats
        of sealer and varnish will cover the sheathing and all
        joints.</font></p>

        :-</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">Rough sketches were
        produced indicating plan and chine plus a side elevating
        showing the sheer and keel lines. Station points were
        established coinciding with fore and aft well bukheads
        and tor the cabin front.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">From these sketches
        half sections taken at the station points permitted a
        skeleton, card half-model to be built onto a wooden '
        Backbone '.All the card profiles were extended to a
        common level, that of the building board.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The sections were adjusted
        by eye, trimming and where necessary, the addition of
        card extensions to ensure smooth lines throughout.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The bulkhead and
        intermediate former dimensions were then transfered to
        3/16&quot; ply strengthened by 1/2&quot; x 1/4&quot;
        blocks to provide a land for the sheathing which was to
        be1/16&quot; ply.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The spruce strip shear strakes were
        prebent by soaking on a wet towel overnight then
        springing round a block for an hour or so. In this way an
        approximation of the plan curve was achieved although
        some force was required to persuade them into the
        eventual 3D configuration of the shear.</font></p>

        strakes were installed using PVA and pins. The hull would
        eventually be released from the board by sawing through
        the extensions of the frames.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The ply side sheathing was checked
        for fit, and final adjustments to the frames. The
        sheathing templates were again from Kellogs cornflake
        packets, easily marked and cut (slightly oversize ). The
        bow and stern ply was trimmed after the adhesive hardens,
        as was the shear line. </font></p>

        reduced to the eventual deck level. Meanwhile being
        removable they permitted ease of sheathing with the
        1/16&quot;ply. When removed the blocks were set in the
        vice for final profiling. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Conventionally the sheathing to the
        underside of a hull is fixed first, in this case, on the
        prototype there is a cover fillet fixed along the joint
        between bottom / side sheathing , allowing the sides to
        be placed first thus providing a greater ' Land ' or
        bearing for adhesive at the joint.</font></p>

        the rough profile of the foredeck camber was installed. A
        steel rule run across the foredeck block permited the
        stretcher to be finally shaped ready for the sub deck
        members ...laying these was akin to building a section of

        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Small blocks were added to

        to allow the side deck camber to be planed, guided by the

        longitudinal timbers running above the window openings
        such that a frame was formed on which the subsheeting for
        the roof could be laid.This took the form of i/16&quot;
        planks as shown in the next illustrations. During this
        operation as with any joint which is not to be permanent
        a peice of clingfilm in the joint space prevents
        adhesion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A lipping of 1/8&quot;
        dowel was bonded into place around the roof, this was to

        was added over the planking. The ply was glued an pinned
        into place and once the temporary pins were removed the

        excellent craftsman yet still spoil a piece by careless
        painting, or lack of preparation. He was right of course
        and preparation is the key to success. I have used most
        types of paint, spraying, aersol driven cellulose and
        acrylics as well as enamels etc. For models that have to
        undergo stringent conditions, handling, immersion in
        sometimes dirty water etc. I still find it difficult to
        beat Dulux household paints. Of course for exhibition
        models with fine detail any of the paint sytems are
        adequate and although expensive, simple to use. </font></p>

        face="Arial">nough history however, back to the
        model.........</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Fairleads for the anchor warp,
        foresail and fixings for the mainstays were turned up and
        soldered to small fixing plates. To prevent loss of very
        small turned parts at the time of parting-off I slip a
        small length of rod in the tailstock chuck and enter it
        into the bore so that the turned part simply spins onto
        that when the cut is complete and does not disappear into
        the swarf in the tool tray ! Next some minute fittings
        and bottle jacks for the rigging !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The chain locker hauwse caused a
        few problems, the barrel was turned fom brass and the
        cover, which traps the chain once hauled in, was soldered
        in place. A length of chain with a split link was then
        inserted from within the barrel, projecting through the
        retaining slot and the length of chain connected to the
        anchor. The whole could be then installed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">With the mast stepped a
        start was made in rigging the boat.</font><font
        face="Arial">Bearing in mind the tendency of wood to warp
        and bow when cut to slender sections a 40 year old, well
        seasoned, piece of deal from an old cabinet was selected
        for the mast. This was cut to the required slender
        section on the faithful 45 year old bandsaw then tapered.
        Having decided that, for the present, the model was for
        display only, sails would not be added. The track in the
        mast for the sail is replicated only by a 1/16&quot;
        slot. The roller for the sail hoist was turned on the
        lathe and installed on a pin through the mast.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Bottle screws in brass were turned,
        drilled and tapped ( with only a right hand tap available
        incorporating a two right hand threads! ) This meant that
        in order to set up the stays it is necessary to pre-wind
        the stay in an anti-clock fashion such that when the
        upper bolt of the stay is inserted ino the body of the
        bottle screw it can be spun clockwise to tighten the
        stay....a matter of expediency, and calling for fine
        judgement ! Think about it !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Splices simulating ' Talurite '
        cramps are from small diameter copper tube split and
        crimped to grip the stays. Final adjustment to the
        tension can be made before final crimping. A great source
        of materials such as stranded wire for rigging is to be
        found at </font><a href="http://www.psaeroproducts.com/"><font
