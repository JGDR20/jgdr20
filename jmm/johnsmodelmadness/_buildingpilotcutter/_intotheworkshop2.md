The opportunity of spending a few half hour spells in the workshop has allowed me to start again
at my beginings and a move made to add the bulwarks.
I have built several boats before but mainly of modern prototypes with simple
geometry...However this one is proving quite difficult.

As a principle I always start with a difficult bit ! Having looked at a range of Cutters on the web
I decided to combine several stern details.

				<p>At this stage all this looks a bit messy but to retain verticality where the
				rounded bulwark joins that further forward I had to fix some temporary supports to
				the hull and do some fairing off of the hull locally.</p>

				bulwark, the whole will be stiffened by addition of a hardwood capping later.</p>

				Some thought determined that the strip is '3 dimensional' in that it is curved in

				The answer to its production was that oversize strips were lightly pinned in place
				then the deck line and a line indicating the depth of the strip was plotted onto
				this.
				The final positions of the sections of strip were marked on the hull before each
				piece was shaped then fastened in place.</p>
				<p>Along the run of the hull the ply is long grain, then cross grain at the bow
				and stern, to facilitate the tighter bend.</p>

				The image shows the first few in the rough and work on the next.
				The ports are commenced by chain drilling the ply bulwarks, not easy to avoid
				breaking out the thin inner veneer face.
				The ports are cut nearly to size and will be finished using a 'Go, no go' slip of
				metal.
				Provided the drilled holes are fairly close, each to the next, a scalpel frees the
				scrap ready for finishing.
				Miniature jewellers files will finish the job.</p>

				finished width of the capping.</p>

				Two sections of mahogany sheeting were deeply scribed wth the lines of joints and

				into individual planks.
				This was acheived by overbending over the side of a saucepan of appropriate
				diameter.
				The two halves of each sheet were cut to fit and bonded into place, a series of
				offcuts and weights ensuring they were snug on the ply cabin top.</p>

				capping / washboard side was held whilst the adhesive hardened.

				further detail.</p>
