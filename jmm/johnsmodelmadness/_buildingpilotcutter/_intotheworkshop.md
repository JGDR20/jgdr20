## Into The Workshop
The lines were transferred to my recycled 3/4" knotty pine board, gifted by a friend,
being careful to place the parts such that best use was made of the available surface.

Weight is not a consideration in the case of a static model employing ' Bread and butter '
construction, the interior of the hull will not be visible and the timber is thicker than
that normally employed in this construction;
additional timber can be allowed in the width of the individual layers of wood to ensure
that there will be sufficient to cater for changes in the section of individual parts
when carving to hull profile.
