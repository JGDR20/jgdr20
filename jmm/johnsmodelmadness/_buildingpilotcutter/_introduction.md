Having built a variety of scale and freelance radio controlled model boats and one static model of a Silhouette ' sailer / trailer ',
a vessel close to my heart, I became interested in the history of pilot cutters:-

Pilot cutters of a type which date back to the late 19th, early 20th Century ( some of even the older ones are still sailing )
were designed to cope with all manner of weather and extremely rough seas.
Their purpose was to ferry harbour pilots to incoming packets to strike contracts for pilotage through difficult channels into harbour.
Quite similar vessels plied their trade from a number of major ports around our Island, often they raced to compete with other pilots.
Their function demanded speed and the ability to sail in the worst of conditions.

The history of the boats can be read on many sites on the web, and replicas of the better known craft are still built for enthusiastic sailors.
To read about them and view images all that one needs to do is visit Google Search ' Images ' and type in ' *pilot cutters* '
then click on items of interest, this will take you to appropriate websites.
YouTube ' Pilot cutter videos ' show many illustrations of cutters afloat and under construction, a mine of information.
Shots from the videos for personal use only and for reference purpose can be downloaded by pausing the video and using one of the many ' freebee ' capture programs\*.
