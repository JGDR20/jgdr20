## Establishing Details
As described above my search began on Google. I studied the detailed images, videos and looked at various lines drawings.
All the boats were notable for the hull design which combined speed with stability while carrying substantial areas of sail.
The hull form is best appreciated by viewing pictures of boats under construction on the sites of present day boat builders in the UK and abroad.
As this model will be compounded from views of original boats, renovations and recent productions on the web,
also what I have deciphered from the various lines drawings, the model should convey a ' Picture ' of the breed of boats.

				<p>I intend to build the model using ' Bread and butter ' hull construction.
				This involves cutting layers of wood to the plan profile of the vessel providing a series of sections from keel to deck.
				These are bonded together and the final hull form is generated by carving from the resultant roughly shaped solid block
				guided by the joint lines between layers.</p>
