## I built two sailing boats, mainly from scrap !
I suppose this falls into the category of ' Coarse ' boat construction.

In line with my philosophy of building cheap ( but to the best standard my skills allow )
I set out to build a boat that would replicate the manner in which full size boats sail,
not whipping about at mad speeds as, for instance, some kit boats do.

Attached are some pictures of the construction and testing of the boat later replicated in a larger,
sister boat which I sail on my ' Home ' water, and some great sailing some time ago at Bognor, and Taunton.

## Materials

* The boat framing really was constructed from kitchen cupboard. They don't make such knot-free material any more !
It was cut down on my 45 year-old bandsaw.
* The hollow mast was a broomstick, sawn and then milled out to provide the track.
* The keel is reinforced with stainless steel ( concrete-reinforcing steel from a friendly builder ).
* The bow and stern blocks were from redundant ' Queen Anne ' legs from a damaged piece of furniture.
* The rigging turnbuckles were from the wire wing-stays of a Walrus flying boat...the turnbuckles being gifted to me years ago by a WW2 Naval airframe rigger.
* Rigging wire is model aircraft control line wire which is immensely strong.
* Lead ballast was from the local roofer ( bought, I have to add ! ).
* Sails are of Nylon / terryene lining material intended for ladies dress linings.
* Paint was domestic Dulux Gloss.
* Radio Control is in this case rudder only, a sail winch may yet be installed..................rudder only control is more demanding anyway.

Apart from the sweat of the brow the total cost of the 1 Metre craft was that of the 1.5 mm. ply, lead, PVA glue, lining material and control wire was about £ 20..............
not bad for hours of pleasure.

As the first model met up to expectations, sailing smoothly in all conditions, the second model was constructed with dimensions scaled up by 20%.
This has also proved to be a success on the water.

Apart from the radio equipment, the all-up total cost of the two boats was less than £60, plus sweat of the brow.
I consider this a great investment considering the hours of pleasure they have given to both younger and older members of the family.

In passing I should mention that a commercial concern in America claims to teach how to sail larger boats using radio controlled model boats.
I am convinced that their claim makes sense as when starting to sail full-size boats my younger family members took to sailing ' like ducks to water ' as the saying goes !

I have been asked for details of some of my boats. I am attaching dimensions of the larger of the two yachts for anyone interested. If you are [click here][LargeYachtDims]
