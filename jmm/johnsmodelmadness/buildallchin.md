## Starting the ' Journey ' ...........some background information

*Further down the page are more detailed descriptions of the component parts*

With two locomotives and a number of stationary engines under the belt we looked around for a more challenging, long term project.
For years we had enjoyed the sight, smells and sounds of traction engines, redolent of our childhood when we watched what seemed like ' Monsters ' towing trains of trailers.
The drivers were always friendly when we chatted with them whilst taking on water and on occasions allowed us up onto the footplate or manstand.
The interest and memories persist.

				The Alchin build to 1 1/2" scale was serialised in ' Model Engineer ' magazine,

At a recent exhibition I watched a fellow visitor purchase the book and took the opportunity to mention what a task he was letting himself in for
......I am sure that he didn't believe me when I said the I had spent 6 years on my model
...he might not take that long, but it may well take him two or three years, depending on his other commitments !

## In retrospect

				Looking back over my activities, I learned a great deal, honed my skills
				and have now a model of which I can be reasonably proud.
				I work slowly and often remake items that do not meet my own set standards.
				Not the least of the challenges was to understand how the engine worked and
				in the back of the mind was always the question....
				' when finished, however long it takes, will it work ? '

The finished model measurements are as follows; 

Length | Width across wheels | Height 
24" (81 cm ) | 12" (31 cm ) | 18" (48 cm )

I keep a log of my modelling activities and see that I made a start on the chimney, fashioned from a piece of reinforcing bar for concrete, on the 1st of February 1996.
The model was completed with the addition of the second-shaft cover on the 17th April 2004 after a total of 1358 hours total worked.

I took a one year ' Sabbatical ', for other modelling activities, ( Building a radio controlled boat ) between 1998 and 1999 making the build a 7 year effort overall.
Of course the overall period included making the various jigs and fittings to construct parts such as the wheels, forming the tender plates, drilling for the pinions in the compensating ring ( Differential ) etc.

The ' Allchin ' boiler was thus sublet, more detail later....

## Part by part

I started with the smokebox end, and the chimney in particular, as a discrete part of the model which would establish whether my skills would adequate for the task. For some long time, just the front end mounted on a stand provided the motivation to carry on and complete the work !

<div align="center" class="image-table">

		<tr>
			<td class="col2">
				<p><strong>The chimney</strong> was a problem for me, mainly due to my choice of material ( High tensile reinforcing steel ) Once the appropriate lathe speed was established the turning and boring was complete using Tungsten tippped tools. The seam was milled and dummy rivets inserted to simulate the rolled steel of the prototype. The chimney cap casting from a proprietary supplier failed to meet the sculptor Henry Moore's saying that ' The required form is in there, all the sculptor has to do is reveal it '</p>
				
				<p>It was remarkable that the supplier having produced capping castings for many years had not been made aware of the failings of this product. Their new pattern avoids the problem for future builders.</p>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<strong>The smokebox and smokebox door</strong> next on the list. The weld in the rolled tube for the smokebox called for a tungsten tipped tool to be employed in turning the outside diameter, otherwise no problems. The smokebox angle demands careful turning for fit and the rivetting is awkward, calling for an angled snap. The door casting needed only light turning to preserve the cast-in makers name. The hinge plate called for care in turning and fitting to the door section. Hinging and pinning is tricky for a novice although a final pass using a reamer with the door clamped into place overcomes any initial small innaccuracy .

				<p><strong>The wheels</strong> provided few problems although requiring a substantial amount of work in fabricating the hubs Particular care is required in machining the seatings for the spokes in the hind hubs, due to their oval shape. Rather than sweating, Araldite was employed to secure all the hub elements. We are quite prepared to take advantage of modern technques even whilst building models of early in 20th Century prototypes.</p>

				<strong>The hornplates</strong> were set out and the many holes drilled in accordance with the, now,much thumbed drawing. At this stage the relative positions of the holes for bearings to the three shafts and the hind axle are critical and need checking and rechecking prior to setting-up in the lathe for boring. Many of the rivets are dummy rivets, and the legend at the bottom of the detail identifies various hole sizes which serve different purposes in final assembly.
