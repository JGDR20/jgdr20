## A Look Back At The Construction

As a response to visitors to the site who have mailed requesting more information on the model this section has been inserted as a supplement to the page on Pixie.
The illustrations are described for the enjoyment of the narrow gauge locomotive enthusiast.
Construction techniques are described and will hopefully assist in the construction of models of a similar nature.

Actual suspension is catered for by rubber blocks inserted between the upper horn member and the axle boxes of the front axle. In practice this proves adequate to provide equalisation. Further detail in the above illustration will be described later.</p>

				<p>The smokebox saddle is evident in this view it was cast in phosphor bronze at the same time as the cylinder blocks. Not being an expert pattern maker, rudimentary oversize patterns were produced, allowing the required shapes to be 'excavated' by milling, drilling and boring.</p>
				<p>The coupling blocks were fabricated from a number of TIG welded pieces of mild steel. This avoided the task of making a pattern with cores to form the slots. These assemblies were subsequently milled and ground to shape.</p>

Although the frames etc. are bright mild steel,the platework is mainly of stainless steel, quite tricky for the amateur to work, drill bitts are easily burned out unless kept cutting, but it is guaranteed to ensure longevity ( of the model ! ).</p>

				<p>The wheels being solid ( spokeless ) were cast from a simple pattern of turned hardwood produced by a woodturner friend. The balance weights were carved and planted onto the pattern prior to despatch to the foundry where they were cast in grey iron. The crossheads were fabricated from m.s. and fitted with slippers milled from phosphor bronze.</p>

The chimney was turned ( with difficulty ) from a length of high tensile reinforcing steel from a construction site. The profiled buffer beam permits withdrawal of the pistons, the backend of the cylinder block being solid. Immediately behind the buffer beam is an axle-driven pump for topping up the boiler, this is of course not required on the prototype with its injectors. The chimney was tapered between centres. The saddle was produced intially by turning and subsequently by filing.</p>

### The Footplate And Boiler Backhead

Much of the fun in building Pixie came from the detailing, some might call this ' Rivet counting '.
Pixie is not a super scale model and, where stock materials were close in scale size to those of the prototype, stock materials were used.
Details such as the number of rivets in the platework have however been adhered to,
also bolt and rivet sizes are to scale to the extent that the main angle to frame rivets have been turned from stock.

				<p>The regulator valve is sited in the steam dome and actuated by the regulator lever. The cleading to the boiler is trimmed by an angle steel conforming to the outline of the backhead. The shelf copied from the prototype must provide an excellent storage place for the driver's tea can.</p>
				<p>The boiler for Pixie was built by Cheddar Models as at the time of constructing the model we had insufficient means of heating such a large mass of copper !</p>

				<p>I am sure that the visitor can sense the thrill experience when firing up the loco for the first time after some years of anticipation! Paraffin soaked sticks and some crushed steam coal soon generated enough steam to permit the blower to be employed in building the 'incandescence' necessary to power up the works. We tried a gas burner earlier but it was unsuccessful - Coal is the thing.</p>
