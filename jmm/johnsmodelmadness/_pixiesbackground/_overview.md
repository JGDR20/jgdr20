Here was a locomotive that was mechanically quite simple for a relative beginner to construct; it would be accessible for survey and was in the hands of friendly folk prepared to assist with provision of information.
The railway was within 25 miles of home base, so that the survey could be staged over a series of visits.
Above all, the locomotive had an atmosphere and charm which appeared to the writer to convey the very essence of narrow gauge railways.
The decision has never been regretted and has, over the past twenty years, opened up a whole new interest in the mechanical engineering of railways and of narrow gauge railways in particular.

At this stage the modeller intending to work in narrow gauge has to come to terms with the fact that just as much work will be involved in producing his chosen model as in producing one to run on standard gauge.
Pixie was ten years in the building, through choice. Some things are too good to hurry and although one is always keen to get one's
locomotive onto the track, later efforts can be savoured, and perhaps greater attention paid to detail.

With the exception of the boiler, lubricator and gauges, everything including patterns for the castings was produced from scratch.
Occasionally where there was only a small difference from the scale dimension it was possible to use off- the-shelf materials for
platework, shafts etc., otherwise sawing, milling, turning, filing and polishing were the ' Order of the day '

Although construction of a sizeable standard gauge model locomotive may make excessive demands on the capacity of one's workshop and equipment,
narrow gauge locomotives are generally simpler in design and, at the same scale, work up smaller in model form.
(This fact can be used to advantage by the modeller 'moving-up' to a larger scale).
The flavour of work and operations on a narrow gauge line can be replicated within a small workshop and in ones own backyard.

Model engineering activities ' along narrow gauge lines ' provide every opportunity for the incorporation into models of the very things that
attract us to the prototype, to make and handle the artifacts that would otherwise, unless one works as a volunteer on a preserved line, be literally beyond reach.
It should be remembered however that modelled on 5" Gauge quite a small locomotive such as PIXIE, at some 10 feet overall,
will be more than 25" long in model form and of such dry weight that it is beyond one (normal) man's lifting ability!
Quite apart from the weight of the model the physical size, 25" long x 11.5" wide by 20" high are dimensions to be reckoned with
when it comes to handling in the workshop and between shop and track!
