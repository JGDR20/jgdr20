## The End Result
The completed model was tested on compressed air at the local garage to the amazement of two motor mechanics it shot across their workshop, nearly destroying some of their equipment.
The model was steamed several times on a test track in the garden.
As is my practice I cleaned all preparatory to priming and painting in generic colours (Unlined) and added it to my collection.

Years on, I still have the pleasure of owning and viewing the model.
Memories of the building process which involved a whole new learning process for a concrete engineer are ' Worth their weight in gold ! '

				<p>Pixie completed, gleaming in a generic paint job. It has been steamed and then cleaned-up. Here the loco has the ' Show ' cab installed. The alternative is a ' Driving ' cab which has openings for access when firing and to enable a view of the gauges.</p>
				<p>There are two roofs and two rear spectacle plates, one is complete for exhibition, the other is a skeleton to enable access to the controls and for firing. That in the image above is the exhibition set-up.</p>

## On The Track At Last

An exciting time ! First run on the temporary track, No 2 son at the regulator.
The driving trolley replicates a wagon on the Talyllyn N.G. Railway.
