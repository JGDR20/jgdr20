## The Survey and Construction Process
During a preliminary visit to the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway at Pages Park, Leighton Buzzard
ground rules regarding my access to the prototype were outlined by the professionals and amateurs who operate the line.
I was permitted to commence my survey.
Many hours were spent in the engine shed and along the line sketching, measuring and photographing the locomotive.

				<p>From the dimensional drawings made at Pages Park, sketches were made of the key compnents, these would provide an overall picture of the parts to be made and prove useful in esatablishing the sequence of fabrication and machining operations.</p>

				<p>Materials were ordered, patterns made and construction commenced with...the Chimney ! This being to our mind one of the defining features of the locomotive as are the engine, motion and the saddle tank. Work on such a model is mainly in mild steel, phosphor bronze, cast iron and in my case stainless steel, all requiring differing machining techniques.</p>
				<p>Castings were produced by a friendly building fixings firm specializing in bronzes and alloys.</p>

				<p>With the valve gear installed and the smokebox and chimney mounted, we awaited the boiler.</p>
				<p>There was plenty of work to do however, fabricating the saddle tank, and completing the cab, plumbing, brakes etc.</p>
				<p>The sheets alongside Pixie area few of the many ( 150 ) dimensioned sketches prepared at site</p>

				<p>Now the locomotive is really taking shape. The major components are assembled, mainly constructed using stainless steel. The saddle tank is of mild steel for flanging purposes, lined with fibreglass.</p>
				<p>Cast items, cylinder blocks and valvechest combines, als wheels were cast from phosphor bronze using hardwood patterns prepared from site sketches.</p>
				<p>Coupling blocks are fabricated from 12 pieces of mild steel, welded and shaped by grinding.</p>

				<p>Among the more difficult items of construction for the ' Tyro ' was the weighshaft and dieblocks which provide the means of reversing and adjusting the valving, being rotated by a lever on the footplate.</p>
				<p>The accuracy of the work in dieblock illustrated is critical to the performance of the locomotive.</p>

				<p>Due to the considerable heat requirements in boiler manufacture, unlike in the case of Tich which boasts a home built boiler, Pixie's boiler was purchased from Cheddar Models who manufactured to the survey sizes, with due adjustments to ensure free steaming.</p>

				<p>With the boiler and all plumbing installed a start could be made on painting. This necessitated complete dismantling, degreasing and removal to a dust free environment ( the greenhouse ).</p>
				<p>Bondaglass primer was applied followed by many coats of spray applied cellulose and acrylic paint.</p>
				<p>The smokebox and chimney received motorcycle exhaust enamel.</p>

				<p>Of course a driving trolley is an essential in the case of models of this size and a prototype was selected such that coal and water could be carried if required. To reduce drag the wheels, turned from a billet that I found on the road in my travels ( It had literally fallen off of a lorry ! ) were fitted with ball bearings. Snatch on startup is reduced by a heavy spring around the drawbar.</p>
