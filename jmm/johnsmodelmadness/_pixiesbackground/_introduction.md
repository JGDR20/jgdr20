## Introducing Pixie
I am fairly proud of the model that I built from a survey and from raw materials and castings.
I learned a lot about the loco, its builders and the folk who maintain and run it.

In this page I include background on the loco, a description of the parts and comment on the build.
The work involved is similar to that in producing other locomotives to any scale and hopefully will help other modellers,
as well as interesting those who just enjoy railways and all that.

The writer's decision to model PIXIE (the Kerr Stuart ' Wren ' Class locomotive KS4260 / 1922) was based upon several factors.
First and foremost was the impression I had on sighting the little locomotive as it coasted into Pages Park Station
on the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway one spring afternoon.
It seemed incredible that a locomotive, produced initially for work on the installation of a sewer in 1922,
should 60 years later be found running like a Rolls-Royce and doing useful work in a domestic setting.

Enquiries revealed a little of the history of the locomotive, the fact that after the completion of the Barkingside sewer contract
it had for some years worked in the Wilmington Road Quarry of Devon County Council, eventually being purchased by
the Industrial Locomotive Society and brought to Leighton Buzzard in the late 1960's.
The locomotive has an overall length of something over 10 feet, it weighs 3 Tons 7 cwt empty, and 4 tons 3 cwt in working order.
The inside framed locomotive has Hackworth valve gear and is resplendent in attractive livery of black, green and gold.
