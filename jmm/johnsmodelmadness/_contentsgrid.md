I hope that the models illustrated and in some cases the description of the steps in their construction will tempt the visitor to try his / her hand at building the model that they have been thinking about and which perhaps prompted them to visit this site. I show some of the construction techniques and will later describe some of the difficulties encountered in the course of construction and how they can be overcome
I enjoy using materials recovered from sources such as scrap and recycled objects, buying only items that I cannot make such as electronic components. For engineering projects I employ castings where I cannot fabricate. This provides practice in pattern making !
