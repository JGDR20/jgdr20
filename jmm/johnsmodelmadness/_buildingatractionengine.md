A major project carried on over a period of six years was construction of the Allchin traction engine ( Road locomotive ) to 1 1/2" scale.
The six year term resulted from shortage of spare time due to a job which involved lots of travelling !

To see the construction of the Allchin from plans produced by the late great model engineer W. J. Hughes and a description of the many parts [click here][BuildAllchin].

Following contact initially built up over the Internet with my now good friend **[Peter Beck][Beck]**, a German model engineer, pictures of my models now appear on his site.
Peter is an accomplished model engineer and we share many interests, he has also built the Allchin and a number of locomotives, so appreciates the hours of application required.
Peter has recently built a 1" to the foot scale traction engine ' *Minnie* ' to a design by L.C. Mason.

Also........These recent images show Peter's recently completed model of the 'Rocket ' a real Tour de force.

The model exhibits first class engineering and model making skills.
