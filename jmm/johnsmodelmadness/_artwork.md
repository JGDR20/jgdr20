In the past many happy hours have been spent on holiday roaming through Cornish towns and 
villages.  
Now memories flood back of the life that thrived around the tiny fishing boats moored and at 
the quayside.

The larger harbours have a lifeboat station as well as waterside houses, pubs and hotels.

Cottages and houses, many fronting directly onto the narrow streets, are perched on the 
surrounding hills.

Hopefully this sketch conveys the essence of such a scene.

When time permits I will be adding a gallery of items from my sketchbooks.....

## Cartoons and technical books

Each month for more than 25 years I produced a monthly ' quasi/technical ' cartoon page based upon my own 45 years in and about concrete construction which included detail, design and supervision through to management and consulting work for a number of well known firms and institutes.

Over the years I produced some 3,000 unique sketches of construction activities featuring the activities of a mythical construction worker.
He is my creation, **devised more than 25 years ago** and *any similarity between him and any other character real or mystical that has emerged in recent years is entirely coincidental !!!*

The image above is the cover to a compilation of those cartoons in a book ' A practical look at concrete ' \[ISBN: 0946691835] published by [The Concrete Society UK][ConcreteSoc].

On the left my main character ' Cubco man '  
He found himself in many demanding situations

The illlustrations showed him working in a variety of construction work, learning the possibilities (and sometimes the problems) of a range of construction tasks, methods, materials and emerging techniques.

His was a very extended learning curve........................................................... just as mine has been !
