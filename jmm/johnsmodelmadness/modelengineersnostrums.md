## Standards

Establish an acceptable standard, and work to it. It is better to finish a 
working model than to find yourself endlessly remaking parts to meet your 
improving standards. 

Do not shrink from scrapping a substandard part which will affect the 
PERFORMANCE of the finished model. 

Try to avoid the ' last finishing touch ' that sometimes spoils the job ! 

## Research ( And Survey For Scratch Building )

Your local reference library is a mine of information, the librarian will help 
in locating sources. You can photocopy items of interest for use in the 
workshop. The ' Web ' is of course the ultimate source, good browsing and search 
techniqueis essential however. 

Always have a program in mind for site survey visits, this will save time and 
ensure that you get the information you need. 

Pre-prepare sketches where possible these save time and act as a reminder to 
ensure that the key dimensions are taken during your visit. 

Take every opportunity that presents itself for listening to ' real engineers '. 

Beware the local ' expert ', helpful as he may be, often he only remembers what 
is important to him, always try to get authentication from an additional source. 

Take photographs and make sketches, these supplement dimensions which have to be 
interpreted back in the workshop. 

Include a measuring tape, rule or coin in your close-up photographs this will 
assist in determining sizes later. 

Make notes to accompany your sketches. 

Maintain a source file, include web addresses, press cuttings and photographs. 
Note down details of articles of interest in journals, it is often necessary to 
check on some specific technique, temperatures, clearances and suchlike 
information. It takes a long time to thumb through 20 years back numbers of 
MODEL ENGINEER ! 

## Workshop

Ventilation and lighting ( particularly local to machines ) are essential 
considerations in the workshop. Many hundreds of hours will be spent there. 

Heating, even minimal to raise the dew point is a great asset, whatever the 
fabric of the shop. 

Try always to have a clear idea of the sequence of operations which you intend 
to employ. Once that chucking piece has been cut away concentricity may be lost. 
Once a special set-up has been broken down it will be difficult to replicate. 

Remember to install important items such as solid axleboxes onto axles before 
final fixing of wheel sets. 

Remember right and left ' handing ' of components, it's easy to make two 
identical fittings, only to discover that one should be of the opposite hand to 
the other ! 

Observe the same safety practices as you would in an industrial workshop, use 
eye and ear protection. 

Always secure work carefully before milling and drilling, use vices, clamps etc. 
to avoid hand and finger damage. 

Swarf spinning on a drill is nearly invisible, take care, it can strip your 
flesh to the bone or at least cause a bad cut. 

Avoid the use of scrim or rag adjacent to revolving materials, they are easily 
caught-up and can drag a finger, or hand, into the ' works '. 

After cutting lengths from stock materials remove burrs before returning offcuts 
to stock.

Check the fixity of jigs, templates and the workpiece after initial cuts, and in 
the course of the work especially when intermittent cuts are being made. 

Vary your work pattern. Changes improve your interest level and aid 
concentration, never force yourself to work on your model if there are 
distractions, if you are tired, out of sorts or otherwise not really keen to do 
so. 

Clear up the workshop after each session, you'll be more inclined to want to go 
back there and can make greater progress in the next visit. 

Cover down the lathe bed when machining aggressive materials, dusts combine with 
oil to make an efficient grinding paste ! 

If you visualise a problem ahead, put it to the back of your mind and busy 
yourself with some other aspect of the model, the subconscious mind is a 
powerful tool and works wonders, even whilst you sleep ! 

Try not to finish a spell of work on a ' downer ' , if something has gone wrong 
try to correct it before you leave the workshop, or you may never go back to it! 

Make the best use of odd spare moments in the workshop. Whilst you may feel 
compelled to press on with some major part there are always tools which will 
benefit from sharpening or nuts, olives or other small parts to be made. 
Sometimes it is nice to just sit in the workshop and think about the next 
move, often we don't do enough of this! 

Keep a notebook. Note detail changes, record thread sizes and sequence of 
erection. Your model may take some years to build and such detail is easily 
forgotten. Hopefully the model will be passed into other hands eventually and 
records will then prove invaluable. 

Never allow a small child to venture into the workshop unacompanied, they are 
always inquisitive and little hands go everywhere ! 

## Tools

Buy the best tools that you can afford, and buy them now. They are bound to get 
more expensive as time goes on. 

If you store tools in the same place between each use, you will find them 
quickly when you need them, especially important in emergency, when you need one 
in a hurry ! 

Keep workshop tools in the workshop, try to avoid having some parts of your kit 
in the car or the garage, in these cases they are rarely where you actually need 
them for the work in hand. 

If you mislay a tool within the workshop, start to clear up, the tool will soon 
emerge from its hiding place, under something or behind something else ! 

Make a note of loans. With the best of intentions, friends and acquaintances 
often forget the source of a loan and tools get lost forever that way. 

Always sharpen tools after use, that way they will be ready for use when next 
needed. 

## Materials

Store materials methodically, they will be easier to locate and shopping lists 
become easier to prepare when available stock is visible. 

Maintain a ' shopping list ' it is easy to forget some stock requirement when 
surrounded by all the interesting items at your stockist's emporium ! 

Visit your model engineering materials supplier other than at peak periods. The 
man behind the counter has seen it all before. He hears accounts of success and 
failure, knows of the effectiveness of various techniques and can advise on 
materials applications. 

You will find that the supplier knows his stocks and can advise on alternatives, 
particularly such items as near-size castings which with some small 
modification can be adapted for use in your particular model. 

Where funds allow, buy additional pieces of frequently used standard materials, 
the offcuts will always prove useful. 

Keep aggressive materials, acids, chemicals etc. in a locked metal cabinet. 

Always mark containers to indicate the contents, unmarked containers are 
dangerous.

Maintain a well ordered scrap box, view materials with an eye to 
alternative uses to which they can be applied; a scrap radio, TV set or 
even a video cassette can yield endless numbers of useful screws, brackets and 
so on. The older, timber TV cabinets can be transformed into storage shelving, 
or the material which will be well seasoned can provide mounts or bases for 
models. 

Save those chucking pieces, they can provide the material for a valve gland or 
some other small part. 

OK! So it all sounds like the 'Counsel of perfection', but we do manage to 
achieve some of the recommendations ! 

**Take care, and enjoy your model engineering.**
