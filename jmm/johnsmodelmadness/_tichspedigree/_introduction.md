Many years ago, the magazine ' **Model Enginer** ' published, over a period of some years,
a series of articles by a writer using the pen name LBSC ( Taken from that of the London, Brigton and South Coast railway ! ).
He described his writing as ' The words and music '.
These articles and others, all of which have been published in plan and book form,
have introduced thousands of us to model locomotive construction.

Tich was one of dozens of designs by LBSC still being built in amateurs workshops worldwide.

LBSC was a quiet, lonely man who came from a poor family and who was thus used to improvisation,
his articles included practical tips and advice such that the veriest beginner with a small lathe
and some basic metalworking tools could complete a full working model steam locomotive !

As a concrete specialist with a permanent workshop, a good quality lathe by Myford, a drill press and newly purchased milling machine,
with experience gained building a number of stationary engines, Tich seemed to present a great project to get me in to locomotives.( See comments below )
