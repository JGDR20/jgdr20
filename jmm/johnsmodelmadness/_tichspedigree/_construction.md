## The Construction Process

A first reading of the book and some hours spent with the drawings set the scene for materials purchase and ensuring that I had the necessary small tools and light equipment.

I will include more images in the hope that they will assist future builders; this will require a search in the archives.
There will be many more builders and not just on 3 1/2" gauge, I have spotted 5" gauge versions in various spots around the web, and there may be larger.

I work slowly and intermittently and 400 hours of enjoyable workshop time some 20 years ago resulted in the emergence of my first real live steam locomotive.
It ran fine on compressed air. As with all my models having once steamed them I clean and polish them for display.
Tich remains unpainted as the brass and stainless steel looks well.
One day he will have a coat of the varnish used by makers of musical instruments.
