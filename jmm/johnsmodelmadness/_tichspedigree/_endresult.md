## End Result
### A Personal View

I have to admit that initially things were not easy ! There were new processes to be learned.
Having constructed several stationary engines, the basics were there, but now silver soldering and brazing had to be added to the ' repertoire',
also machining techniques which vary from metal to metal such as cutter speeds and the like.

Some parts were made and remade ( There are still some pieces that I would re-remake if time were not now so valuable ).
I learned a great deal from LBSC's writing and from the interest that developed in engineering practice.

**Note of caution:** I still take pride in my early product but believe that, asked to advise a newcomer to the hobby on choice of model,
I would suggest a scale model rather than the generic model of an early 0-4-0 that Tich really is.
The same lessons will be learned but they will finish up ( probably after many more hours workshop time ) with a more desirable end product.

The choice of project has to be be based upon the equipment available in the workshop.
As work proceeds further tools, drills, taps, dies etc. can be purchased as the work demands.
Good tools are always a good investment and properly cared for their value will beat the inflated costs as the years go by.

**Addendum:** An Email from Steve White has confirmed thoughts I had when I completed ' Tich ' as my beginners model.
He writes:-

> I agree wholeheartedly about the choice of Tich as a project, it took 38 years to finish mine - I started at 16 ! Now Tich is finished, he/she? was finished early this year, the chassis was run on air and the valves set, the boiler was hydraulically tested and then steamed using a blowlamp in the firebox, all was well. I made a log during the time leading up to completion detailing the trials, tribulations, house moves, frustrations etc. At completion I looked at it and thought that in the same amount of time with probably less problems I could have been looking at a "Black five" or a "Jinty".

> Apart from the small size of some of the components, at the final fitting stage the whole loco was a giant puzzle requiring a fixed order of assembly so that access could be gained to all the parts. Many times the whole thing had to be almost dissassembled to fit one part and then start again! I am also sure that another Tich could be made from the contents of the scrapbox! ……..all credit to Curly though. I remember seeing on a web site the number of sets of Tich castings that have been sold over the years, they ran into tens of thousands. Where are they all?
