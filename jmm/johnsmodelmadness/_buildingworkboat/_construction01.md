				<p>To add to the interest of the build a different construction method will be used to ensure ' Bags ' of space inside the hull, uninhibited by bulkheads.</p>
				<p>Simple keel, bulwark and chine formers have been laminated from ply and timber and set-up using suitably sized spacers to provide the hull form.</p>

				<p>The superstructure will be kept as light in weight as possible. The seemingly over-wide bulwark frame is such that coamings can be fixed to it to provide the water bar at the base of the superstructure. One or two additional timbers are required to generate the rounded stern quarters.</p>

				<p>As the hull took shape, the centre-of-gravity of the structure could be established simply enough but it is helpful with a new hull containing running gear etc., to know where the actual waterline will be, and what are the chances with a freelance design that, with the batteries and gear installed, it can be made to float at that line.</p>
			</td>

			<td>
				<p>To establish this the hull was ' Gift-wrapped ' in stout plastic sheeting and given a ' Bath test ', weights being added to simulate that of the superstructure, motors etc.</p>

				<p>The result of the ' Bath test ' on the gift wrapped hull showed that the intended waterline could be achieved later, and the material in the sternworks would cause no problem weightwise. With 7lbs plus of weight onboard the shell settled to 1/2" above the intended waterline so plenty of scope for a gel battery, sited low in the ' guts ' of the boat, also motors, controls and superstructure.</p>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>The structural frame with its temporary supports proved sufficiently rigid to allow fairing-off using a power planer, set to a very fine cut...so much less hard work than rasp and hand plane. Anyone who has built a full-size dinghy will know how much work fairing-off makes ! The power planer was long enough to span the profiles and thus cut the ' lands ' for the ply sheathing at the correct angle to allow the 1.5mm ply skin to bed down properly. Care was needed however, to ensure that the planer didn't gobble-up the structural members !</p>

				<p>Whilst 4mm ply was used for the under-stern sheeting which is to support rudder posts and propeller shafts 1.5mm ply proved sufficiently rigid for the hull in general when supported at the bulwark and chine profiles, even where there is a lack of curvature to stiffen it.</p>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>The bottom panels were pinned briefly and the overall shape traced for the first rough cut. My 40 year old bandsaw, with metal cutting blade simply eats the stuff and leaves a smooth edge without ply breakout. PVA adhesive is liberally applied and the pins are driven in, working from stern to bow, ensuring that the ply is fully seated on the formers. Where necessary a hunk of metal provides a ‘ strongback ‘ such that the pin takes all the driving force and the frame does not suffer shock. Pins can be withdrawn or punched-in later.</p>

				<p>Not a lot to be said about the hull side sheeting, although, it has to be said that the process was started, <strong>not</strong> at the stern <strong>but</strong> about 60mm for’ard of the curved stern-quarter formers.</p>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>Coating the frames with adhesive followed by progressive pinning whilst clamping and pressing the skin to the profile formers ensured a good seating. Timing was of the essence here, so the glue coating was applied part along the profiles and completed as the fixings moved for'rd.</p>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>With the sides of the hull sheeted, attention turned to the stern, with its rounded quarters.</p>
				<p>The combination of flair and curve with use of ply offcuts resulted in the need for a gusset piece to be inserted centrally at the stern.</p>

				<img src="/assets/jmm/aftportquarter.jpg">
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>It is not a good plan to attempt to lay on curved sheeting starting at the tangent point...better to first lay some flat sheeting then pull the ply around the curve pinning or clamping as one goes. This ensures a smooth transition from flat to radiussed form. The sheeting should continue on past the curve for the same reason.</p>
				<p>It all looks quite rough in the illustration but filling and sanding are to follow !</p>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>Using this method of generating the hull form, there is a huge amount of space for battery, motor and electronics. The absence of bulkheads offsets the weight of the profile formers which are of 6mm ply, plus the fairing pieces which are laminated onto them to provide lands for the sheeting.</p>

				<p>The bow and stern bulwarks on most boats of this type have pronounced tumblehome at bow and stern. The means of supporting these items on "Freelance'', as the boat is to be named, is illustrated in the sketch herewith. Of course the joint will be planed later to provide a seating for fender strips.</p>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>The bow bulwark took a lot of effort to ensure that it seated onto the profile at the bulwark and onto the foredeck which had been mounted on blocks at the required angle. The curvature ensures the strength to withstand later bumps and it is intended to fit a forward push post.</p>

				<p>At this stage it was time for some small engineering works. The rudders and nozzles on my Rhine ' Pusher ' give excellent steering control and considering that the materials came from the scrapbox, cost little besides my time ( At my age, unfortunately a diminishing asset ! )</p>
			</td>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>So to the lathe and bandsaw. I used 1/16" brass to make the fittings just that bit beefier than those on the Pusher. The nozzle was formed round a piece of scaffold tube then rivetted. The post was turned from brass and a 5/16" M.E. thread cut to take the nuts securing it to the hull..... time 45 minutes in all. The posts are 3/16" diameter brass with a 3/16" threaded portion to engage with the nozzle. The rudder blades are soldered into place. Soft soldering has sufficed on the pusher for 2 years of hard usage and was considered OK here. No Lloyds Certificate perhaps but sufficiently durable for my purpose !</p>

				<p>The propeller shafts, universals and propellers are commercial products purchased from my local friendly model shop ' Wycombe Models '. The temporary fixing is unorthodox; hose clips secure the tubes to posts which run each side of the eventual battery position. These allow for easy adjustment until all is lined up correctly and permanent fixing blocks installed when a dose of Cyano will ensure that nothing moves ( ever again ! )</p>

The work ( or play ) described to this point has taken something of the order of 40 hours.
The cost to date something like £30 for ply, pins and running gear. Estimated final cost will be less than £100.
The build has been carried on in odd hours snatched from my otherwise very domesticated life.

I see this as pretty good value in terms of entertainment,
and an excellent investment when I look forward to the hours of enjoyment my young relatives and I will take from the finished article..............................
