## Continuing the build of the workboat now renamed ' Free Lancer ' at 20th August

				<p>Controls and some instruments, also the Skipper and First Mate have been installed in the wheelhouse. The bollards and part of the towgear have been fabricated, sprayed and are now set in place on deck. Hawse holes have been turned up on the lathe and set into the bulwarks.

## 135 Hours
... and counting. OK so I needed a change. The next job will be to insert the props and nozzles, and install the twin motors.

## 150 hours

Now at 150 hours into the build the boat is taking on the appearance that I envisaged when I started out early in July.
It is a mix of many of the features that I enjoy when looking at the real thing and if nothing else it has character !

Motors have still to be installed using a solid connection during fixing in place of the eventual universal joint.
This to line motor and shaft, critical to vibration-free running.
This is an idea gleaned from Martin, Webmaster and owner at [Model Boat Madness] - a site that I visit frequently
and where Martin kindly exhibits models made by many people
( many more skilled than me, but few making freelanced vessels built from scratch and scrap such as **Free Lancer** ).

				<p>Next......... two winches and a crane, also emergency equipment, hatches etc. then the radio, BEC, servo etc. Plenty of work to ' keep me out of mischief '.</p>
				<p>So, for a change, some work in plastic sheet. Fore and aft winches based on two seen on the web.</p>

				<p>The plastic sheet of course is from my local friendly model shop, the winch drums and brake drums from various drainage fittings left over from the last foray into drainage ! They look sufficiently convincing to me ! And look well set up on the boat. I am still debating whether to leave the boat ' As new ' or to weather it to present an in-service appearance.</p>

				<p>Now for some more plastic fun, building a convincing looking crane. I don't like making non-working items but a working crane would be too demanding on my spare time. I have seen a few illustrated in Model Boat Magazine and applaud their makers efforts.....not for me however !</p>
