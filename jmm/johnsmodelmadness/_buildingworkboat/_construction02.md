## Continuing the build of ' Freelance ' 10th August 2004

I found a picture of a workboat with a pushpost and am incorporating the feature into ' Freelance ' with some difficulty owing to the bow geometry.
You have only to look at illustrations of the craft that the construction industry use in offshore work to see the immense variety available to the modeler, let's not put them all on one boat though Eh !

				<p>So now it was time to concentrate on the upper works. I gave myself a headache with the geometry by having the deckhouse sides inclining inboard as well as a change in line to maintain the side companionways at a sensible width. The technique that resolved the problem was to shape up each 3mm ply panel, hold it in place using small G-clamps, fit the blocks that to stiffen the joints, then drill and pin, leaving the pin heads proud for subsequent removal. On their removal the small overlaps were sanded off, and corners rounded using the minidrill.</p>

				<p>I use a 50 mm diameter rubber sanding disc and stick standard, coarse wet and dry to it using PVA. This holds the abrasive but allows easy replacement. The disc is left under a weight overnight, to ensure that the face of the freshly bonded wet and dry finishes up perfectly flat. This all seems a palaver but a lot of discs can be cut from one sheet of wet and dry.</p>

				<p>At this stage it seemed, in light of the ' Out of my head ' design, worthwhile running another ' Bath test ' to check the freeboard with all the gear onboard. The boat floated level and with plenty of freeboard to allow more additions in the form of deckhouse, crane, winches, bridge deck and all the other details such as rails and mast. The polythene sheeting serves to keep the hull sheeting dry, as it is not yet sealed.</p>

				<p>The pushpost comprises 7 pieces of softwood, necessary to get a fit to the hull and provide the necessary vertical push face. It will be faced with ply at the front edge and the addition of vertical rubber fenders will complete the job...later ! Accurate attachment to the bow presented difficulties, solved by lightly attaching the two main parts into place temporarily with rubber cement, this allowed adjustment for square and plumb with the boat level on it's stand, marking the hull when all was correct. the pieces could then be peeled off for drilling. Next they could be repositioned to the marks and pinned using PVA adhesive for the permanent joint.</p>

				<p>The recumbent figure on the foredeck is a mannikin that I use to remind me of the scale that I am working to. I make no drawings for model boats ...it's all in the head you see ! The mannikin, a US soldier will be carved and repainted to become one of the crew of ' Free Lancer ' The name is evolving as we go !</p>

				<p>In the illustration the two pieces of ply on the foredeck are test pieces. All joints are made with PVA and just to make sure of its waterproof properties I soaked a joint for three days to test it.......100% OK.</p>
				<p>This is reassuring as in practice joints are protected by sealer and several coats of paint, and anyway are seldom more than an hour in the drink! I also soaked my lightweight filler, ( Bondafiller Light ) for the same time and again had success. The supplier tells me that the light weight is achieved by minute glassfibre balls in the resin; this makes sanding and carving easier than conventional 2-part fillers.</p>

				<p>I made a mock-up ( Yes I've made a few muck-ups in my time too ! ) out of cornflake box card, and stuck it together with sellotape. This enabled me to get the critical angles correct when cutting up the 3mm ply. The window openings were started by drilling the corners using a side and end mill and the straight side cuts by Stanley knife.......................... and I still have the blisters.</p>

				<p>My model shop told me of the accelerator that can be used with cyano glue, what a whizz ! I use it combined with medium cyano and it saves a lot of holding time yet the few minutes before applying accelerator can be used for adjusting the angles etc. The accelerator is an aggressive material and must be used with care for eyes and lungs.</p>

				<p>I had to resort to buying more 3mm ply to complete the bridge deck, I wonder where the ply goes. The model shop proprietor reckons that it is all over my workshop floor in the shape of sawdust.</p>

				<p>I do seem to have a lot of odd-shaped offcuts, never mind, they will come in useful when I look for bulwark support brackets. If not there they will be used in my 3D cartoons such as this one. It is entitled ' Stay in the shallow end ' a warning that many a fond parent has issued to their offspring over the years !</p>

				<p>Now is the time for hull filling and sanding, and a start on the fittings to hold radio, speed controller etc. Then it will be bulwarks, winches, towposts and all the other interesting bits ! Culminating in what a friend calls ' The spoiling bit ', that paint job !</p>

			<td colspan="2">
				<p>Card templates provided the ( almost ) eventual shape of the aft bulwarks and these were duly soaked on the outer face and persuaded onto the recess left at deck level and fixed with PVA and pins. It was then a fairly straightforward job to infill with the side bulwarks. Joints along the bulwarks will be reinforced by the stanchions(?) yet to be fitted inside the bulwark prior to installing the capping. With 3mm ply and a very sharp plane it is possible to get a fair line along the whole side of the boat. Freeing ports are yet to be cut, left till now to avoid distortion occuring whilst fitting the ply.</p>

				<p>Bulwarks installed. Holding the ply to the bend and fixing it by glueng and pinning was one of theose operations calling for four hands ! Here the bulwarks are trimmed ready for strutting and capping.</p>

				<p>The hull has had 2 coats of varnish as a seal and then 2 coats of red primer. Soon we will be back to the bath with all gear installed to establish the actual waterline. This will be marked as 'Freelance ' floats using a waterproof pen fore and aft. Later the line will be completed using the usual pencil and set square dodge.</p>

## 70 hours
Now at 70 hours into the build of ' Freelancer ' there is evident progress.
I suppose that after 70 hours of scratchbuilding I am at about the stage that the kitbuilder is at when he opens the box.
As it is I have struggled some; I have this picture in my mind of what I want the boat to look like,
there are details from many boats included in this build. ...
railway modelers say ' There is a prototype for everything ', and so there is.

				<p>A large hatch in the afterdeck will similarly serve the radio gear and servos. The aft deckhouse, base for the funnels is a fixture.

				<p>With the water line established it was time to cut the freeing ports using a minidrill with dental burrs donated by my dentist, great stuff, miniature diamond coated milling cutters eat plywood ! Trouble is that they tend to run away, and need a firm hand !</p>

				<p>A colour scheme is emerging ! The waterline has yet to be finally established, hence the white strip. The reflected light in the image does not do justice to the ' cutting in ' between colours. A coat of matt varnish will improve the overall appearance later. It will also be neecessary to decide on the final appearance, pristine new or weathered in service !</p>

## 120 Hours
... and counting, time to fit out the bridge deck and carry on with painting.
