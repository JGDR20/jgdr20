## So I Decided To Build Another Boat !

I had been looking for a new project to occupy my time and give me something to think about
in otherwise dull times such as when shopping, dishwashing and all the other similar chores.

The present fleet of boats includes two sailing cruisers, a Rhine pusher, a fast launch,
a Clyde Puffer and a crash tender so a workboat offers the variety necessary to add interest.
Freelancing would also add to the fun as it would entail searching the web for interesting layout and detail.
Size is to match that of the Pusher, Puffer and launch,
such that they can all be accommodated in the car.
As regards design the boat will include many of the details that I enjoy when looking at the real thing.

				<p>Completed boat on test, it's a pity the pond isn't larger ! The intention is to enlarge it this spring so that my fleet has a 'Home water'</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

I regard it a challenge to build mainly from scrap, except for the electrics and electronics, so the hunt was on for ply and timber.
The older the timber the more likely it is to be knot-free and of general good quality, superior to stock in the local DIY store !
Post WW2 ply is generally WBP (Simply tested by a good soaking ) and anyway all will be protected by paint or varnish coatings.

So the boat will be all wood and the design from my wooden head.

No doubt we have all read a book on our particular interests entitled ' Coarse Rugby '...or something similar,
my piece that follows could well be entitled ' Coarse Model Boat Building ' as it describes my, sometimes oblique, approach to model making.
