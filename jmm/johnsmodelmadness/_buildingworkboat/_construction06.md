## 252 Hours
... into build, I have trimmed boat on my home pond using plumbers' lead sheeting cut into tiny squares and ' bagged ' for location, it will eventually be fixed in position permanently with plaster.

I have also realigned the motors and cleaned out the propellor tubes as drag caused a couple of fuses to blow.
Thank goodness for the recommendation in Model Boat Magazine regarding fuses.
It saved me a major problem when, in the dusk, I inserted the battery wrong way round, polarity-wise.... which could have cost me an electronic speed controller!

The mast has taken shape, it sits on a wooden post and can be removed and replaced by a shorter version if the ' windage ' is too great in bad weather.

Now there is the tidying up to do, touching up the paint job etc.
I still haven't decided whether to ' Weather ' the paint to give that ' in-service ' appearance,
at least I will spray down with matt varnish to take the gloss off everthing.
Whoever saw a workboat in pristine condition ?

Also since the last update I have been adding ballast, well down in the hull to stabilise the boat
as well as sealing the after hatch (access to the radio and sterngear) using a silicone paste.
The latter to prevent taking in water in bad weather.

				<p>Here's the boat on the only water it will see before next spring, although having been to see the Black Park Boating folk in action we might brave the elements earlier than that ! The boat manouvres well even on our 10' x 10' garden pond and, with the mast installed, still ' Self rights ' from 30 degrees of heel.</p>
