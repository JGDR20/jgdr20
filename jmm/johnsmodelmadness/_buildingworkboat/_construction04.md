## 192 Hours

...and we have a crane ! The last 25 hours of sporadic work, carried out betwen domestic duties have resulted in a crane that I am quite pleased with.
One's own product is not always pleasing and sometimes exhibits, to the builder at least, the defects that he knows are built-in.
OK so I know where are the defects in this latest addition to the boat, but I can live with them !

I must admit that at some tricky stages in the crane construction I thought wistfully of the folk who open the box and...... there are the parts all ready for assembly !
But, as the job neared completion well into the 25 hours of scribing, cutting, filing, bonding, turning, tapping, bending, tapping, painting and fitting
I found consolation in the saying ' You're an ugly little devil but you're mine, all mine ! '
