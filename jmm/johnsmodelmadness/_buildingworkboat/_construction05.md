On a more serious note, it was time to complete the controls on ' Free Lancer '.

				<p>It was pleasing to find that with all the gear installed, and little other than mast, lights, various radars and rails to the wheelhouse deckhead to be installed, that the boat floated level ( and with a little added lead well down in the bowels ) to the previously marked waterline.</p>

## 230 hours
... in and with the controls installed came the moment of truth, the big switch on.
I have installed an MSonics Mariner 15 Bec with an inline fuse and as usual 2 Como 380 motors.
The motors are run in parallel.......................no need with steerable nozzle/rudders for independent speed control.
The radio is 2 channel AM Acoms, it is intended to supplement the two channels with a multiswitch at a later date to facilitate sound effects.

So that is it for now, I will come back to the ' Free Lancer ' page when I test it on the local water.
Meanwhile here are a couple of shots of the near-finished article.

				<p>Here is a ' Full frontal ' view. Demountable cargo deck, more rails, mast, navigation lights, krieglights etc., to be added.</p>
				<p>Heeling tests proved the boat to be remarkably stable, although by no means self righting, sufficient for practical purposes.</p>
