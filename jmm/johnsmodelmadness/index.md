## Visit my model world!

Updated 31 February 2015

Share my models, Kerr Stuart locomotive, Allchin traction engine, boats, OO railway, some artwork and cartoons (By Cubcoman, my alter ego) also a brief biography.

I am 86 years young and have made models of all kinds for more than 70 years.

(Scroll right down this page to see the range of my outputs)

Many of these have long gone to the scrapyard although they are ' Archived ' in a number of magazines.

I illustrate recent a range of my work , some of which quite please me........... I am still learning however !

Click on the images below to go to the relevant pages and descriptions of their construction methods.

I hope that the models illustrated and in some cases the description of the steps in their construction will tempt the visitor to try his / her hand at building the model that they have been thinking about and which perhaps prompted them to visit this site. I show some of the construction techniques and will later describe some of the difficulties encountered in the course of construction and how they can be overcome
I enjoy using materials recovered from sources such as scrap and recycled objects, buying only items that I cannot make such as electronic components. For engineering projects I employ castings where I cannot fabricate. This provides practice in pattern making !
