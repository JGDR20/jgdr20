## Visit my model world!

Share my models, Kerr Stuart locomotive, Allchin traction engine, boats, OO railway, some artwork and cartoons (By Cubcoman, my alter ego) also a brief biography.

I am 86 years young and have made models of all kinds for more than 70 years.

(Scroll right down this page to see the range of my outputs)

Many of these have long gone to the scrapyard although they are ' Archived ' in a number of magazines.

I illustrate recent a range of my work , some of which quite please me........... I am still learning however !

I hope that the models illustrated and in some cases the description of the steps in their construction will tempt the visitor to try his / her hand at building the model that they have been thinking about and which perhaps prompted them to visit this site. I show some of the construction techniques and will later describe some of the difficulties encountered in the course of construction and how they can be overcome
I enjoy using materials recovered from sources such as scrap and recycled objects, buying only items that I cannot make such as electronic components. For engineering projects I employ castings where I cannot fabricate. This provides practice in pattern making !

The cartoons were included in several continuing professional education courses and videos.
I also wrote technical books on concrete topics for various publishers.
The titles, which covered aspects of concrete construction, included:
* Precast concrete production
* Supervision of construction construction
* Formwork design and construction
* and also Quality in precast concrete

Following commissioned service in the Royal Engineers and 40+ years in the construction industry I worked privately as a consultant, my clients included the British Standards Institute as well as fourty or more Architects, Engineers and Contractors at home and abroad.
All this is history for me now as I retired at the age of 75, though I still enjoy many of the contacts made in those times !
I am a past Fellow of The Institute of Advanced Concrete Technology, hold the Diploma of the Institute of Works Managers and was a Silver medalist of the City and Guilds of London Institute.
For 25 of those years I was an examiner for that Institute.

I was extremely fortunate that business travels including those to Scandinavia, Europe, North and South America, North Africa and India provided an opportunity to meet many skilled craftsmen working in a variety of materials, boatbuilders, mosaic and glassworkers and silversmiths as well as mechanical engineers.
The equipment they used in different countries ranged from most sophisticated machines to the most basic tools combined with skills and knowledge handed down over the years.

## We welcome your comments :-
I thank the thousands who have taken an interest in the site, particularly those from all parts of the world who have mailed.
These mails have in a number of cases lead to ongoing ' Email friendships ' and a useful exchange of ideas and methods.

It is great when you mail and tell me what you are doing, whether Model Engineering , Model Boating and any modelling activities.

I will always acknowledge your mail and offer help if needed..... and if I have sufficient knowledge and experience to help !
