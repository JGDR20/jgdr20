I'm putting of the menial tasks of cutting the openings for portholes, anchors and freeing ports as well as capping the bulwarks
to concentrate on the more interesting work on the wheelhouse ! Cutting all the openings in 3/32 ply is hard work.
Very different to trimming the plastic moulding that comes out of the boxed kit.

The exhaust casings have been trimed to height. The shape leaves something to be desired....will think about it.
Access stairs have to be installed and there are still the bulwark cappings and freeing ports to be dealt with.

The stays to the propshafts have been added and the paintbrush has been out.

With the main parts of the hull completed, bulwarks ( ply ) and supports ( from plastic sheet ) installed,
hull and decks primed and openings for hawse holes cut, attention turns to the superstructure.

The boat being larger, though still at 1/24th scale, an additional deck ( chartroom ) has been incorporated.

Time to see how she floats at this stage !

With the stern tubes plugged and without ballast we hiked to the pond, took a deep breath and in she went.
The fish took a dim view but I was fairly pleased with the launch......... no champagne...... just a cup of tea.
Of course without ballast she floats bow high, this can be simply adjusted.

I stuck to the colour scheme started with ' Free Lancer 1 ' as all the paints are to hand,
and anyway it seems appropriate to have a corporate colour scheme.
As can be seen, the hull is now finished painted, the underside had three coats of ' Bondaprimer ' and one of varnish
(' Bondaprimer ' is great stuff; resin-based, dries nice and matt, and quite a good colour for the hull ).

The upper hull was enamelled ' Japlacced ', I have had the can for 20 years at a conservative guess,
it will be treated to a coat of matt varnish in due course.
The bulwarks are blue, garage door colour !.... that's what the paint was for initially.

The decks were shellacc-ed and sprayed with Halfords best car paint,
the engine room wheelhouse etc. have had a coat or two of Dulux, left from the last decorating job.......... no expense spared !

Hawse holes are to be trimmed and the stern deck hatch has to be fitted.
Then comes the interesting part, constructing crane, davit, winches and all the assorted deck fittings.

The length is 850 mm, beam 275 mm and the draught 75 mm.

Length | Beam | Draught
850 mm | 275 mm | 75 mm

I am still open to suggestions regarding suitable motors ( see my question ' Suitable motors for....... ' on the Model Boats Magazine, Scratchbuilding forum ).

Visitors to this page have found it difficult to visualise the difference in size between this boat and Free Lancer.............................
So here they are, side-by-side - both to 1/24th scale.

Now it is September, we have had a few trips to the water and a great visit to the Black Park Model Boat Club Regatta,
lovely weather, great models and lots of enthusiasts.....Well done all those involved !

I have spent some time on the rails and life rafts.
The rails are of 3/32" and 1/16 brass wire and the stanchions are from 1mm brass sheet ( mixture of measure ! )
life rafts are from plastic electric conduit and 2mm plastic card, the stiffeners are slices of the same conduit spread to fit.

The steps to the stern deck are attached to the deck as the 2 upper decks of the superstructure are removable for access to ' The Works '.

The joy with freelance models is that details from many boats can be incorporated and the whole thing can be as the builder wishes,
as long as it is realistic...so we can add bits on just as we wish !

That is the current stage of construction..... so much yet to be done and I haven't yet decided whether to go to 6 V or 12 V and what motors to use.
6 Volt with 2 gel batteries in parallel seems to be favourite as the cost of controllers is reasonable and it will provide a degree of interchangability with the gear in my other boats.

Work has been started on the deck gear, mainly from plastic sheet with accessories difficult to produce in this medium turned from brass on the trusty Myford.
The anchor winch on the photographs of the full size tug, from which I have taken the detail from the web, is electric powered.

On the web example the main and auxilliary winches are hydraulically controlled, here they are shown in the raw, awaiting hoses and access plates.
The model shop must wonder where their stocks of 2mm plastic sheet have gone ! It is quite remarkable how such minor items like this ' Eat up ' the material.
We have at times got quite dizzy from the fumes of liquid poly !

The winches, when complete with brackets for fixing to the deck, will be sprayed with Halfords auto paints - firstly black then a misting of white sprayed from a distance to achieve the appearance of used steel.

It is intended to install a crane and, what would probably be a luxury on a craft of this size, a davit. Perhaps over the top but a challenge to make, just as the winches have been.

We have cut into our precious hull and inserted anchor wells and anchors.
OK, so the wells are on the waterline but as we say there is a prototype for everything and ours is on the ' Antwerp Harbour Tugboat site ' accessed via a link from Martin Davis' site [Model Boat Mayhem]
where details of the type 20 Harbour Tug show a similar arrangement.

With the wells completed attention turns once more to the main winches, adding hydraulic piping and arranging their fixings to the removable hatch.
The prototypes for the winches were also viewed on the Antwerp site... a haven for modellers seeking details from a landlocked situation !

The winches have taken a long time in production, delayed by three spells in hospital
where the planning for future model activities was one of the few things preserving my sanity !

It's great to be back in the workshop and busy with the most important things in life again !

The sterndeck is begining to look like something !
My model boats being ' Standoff models ', the further you standoff the better they look !
Anyway I have added the main cable guide and have sprayed up the winches so the atmosphere is there.

A kind co-viewer of Martin's site [Model Boat Mayhem] advised me regarding the warps and hawsers for the stern winches
which are now a combination of nylon and brass picture-frame wire.
I dyed the nylon with water colour and touched in the brass with acrylic paint to provide the weathered look exhibited by those on the Antwerp Harbour tug site.

There is still space for a crane or, such is the nature of freelance construction as this has developed into an offshore vessel, I might add a davit and a rescue boat.

We have a mast. In keeping with the established hallmarks of the ' Free Lance Towage Company ' the design is similar to that on ' Free Lancer ' but beefed-up.
2mm plastic sheet is used and the geometry established for Free Lancer is incorporated. Rungs and safety hoops are from 1/16" brass wire.

Doubts about stability are entering my mind as 'top hamper ' increaes.... a trip to the bath is indicated.
There will not be much room for adjustment now that the anchor wells have been inserted imediately above the waterline however!
