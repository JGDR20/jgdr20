## Free Lancer 2 ...a new development on my model boat front !

Having built and sailed [Free Lancer][BuildingWorkBoat] all as described on another page, thoughts turned to the next project!

Model boat building promotes various skills such as woodworking and miniature engineering
having the added advantage that construction can be broken down into a series of ' Bite size ' pieces.
Work can be fitted into spare hours and half-hours.
Planning the project and the building process can be carried out anywhere so a boat it had to be.

Having had some success with the workboat ' Free Lancer ' I decided to build a larger version which would provide more space for
accessories such as a sound module and a water pump.

This is Freelancer 2 as I designed it. In tests the on the water when completed, whilst it looked well and performed well,
there was a problem with excessive heel on turns. To see how this problem was resolved go to the last few images on this page.
