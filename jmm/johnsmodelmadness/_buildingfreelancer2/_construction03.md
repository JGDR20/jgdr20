Before the remainder of the bulwarks can be added the decks must be laid.
In order that the decks can be laid, the first level of the superstructure has to be installed so that the decks can butt against them.
The first level, the upper part of the engine room is to be fixed and the chartroom and bridge deck will be removable,
complete with the exhaust casings to provide adequate access to the motors, speed controller, fuses and whatever other electrics I decide to install.
