Before the remainder of the bulwarks can be added the decks must be laid.
In order that the decks can be laid, the first level of the superstructure has to be installed so that the decks can butt against them.
The first level, the upper part of the engine room is to be fixed and the chartroom and bridge deck will be removable,
complete with the exhaust casings to provide adequate access to the motors, speed controller, fuses and whatever other electrics I decide to install.

The shape and form of the superstructure are taking shape in my head and have to be reproduced in ply, etc.
3/32" ply will be used from here on up to reduce weight and keep the centre of gravity low.

Now for the first of the ' Difficult bits ', more difficult that is than persuading the ply sheathing around the bow of the boat,
and the stern quarters ! The upper stringer and the edge of the rear deck panel were planed to the correct inclination for the tumblehome,
including a transition to vertical at the sides to meet the eventual main run of bulwark.

After the raw ply had been offered up, clamped into place and the line of the hull side sheathing marked,
the bottom edge of the bulwark was trimmed to line. A trial fit allowed holes to be drilled for the first few pins.

Time to ' Fall-out and wipe swords ' as the Army saying goes.
It took a quite considerable physical effort to bend, hold and pin the ply into the correct location!

With the deck laying process complete the bulwarks can be finished and cut to size, the tricky bit is getting the level consistent throughout.
Fortunately the 3/32" ply becomes immensely strong when curved to any degree and can be sawn with a tenon saw without damage.

There is a lot of work now in finishing the bulwarks and supports, and capping to be installed so for a change of focus it makes sense to think about the superstructure.

When dreaming up scratchbuilt freelance models it is helpful, as well as producing sketches of the ideas, to translate them into the solid by way of a simple model.
Here Kellog's corn flake packets come to the fore !

With scissors and sellotape it is easy to produce an outline of the proposed ' Work of Art' card and scissors or craft knife have saved me acres of expensive marine ply,
although I seem to have been making more visits to the modelshop of late !

A large part of the fun in freelancing is that favourite details from a variety of boats seen on the water (and nowadays on the web)
can be included, and as long as the scale is appropriate one can shrug-off the ' Rivet-and-plate Counters ' - much as their work is to be admired.

Using PVA adhesive on simple surfaces the early adhesion is such that clamps and clips (the latter on a card from the ' Cheapo ' shop, Â£1 ) are sufficient to ensure a sound joint.
Critical joints will be further reinforced by what joiners call 'rubbing-in' small glue blocks of scrap material.
Next step........................the bridge deck/wheelhouse, and exhaust casings.

The superstructure is taking shape. I have drawn on details from many boats on the web and am adding ideas as they come to mind.
The chartroom and the wheelhouse ( the latter being the next part of the build ) will be removable for access to the ' guts 'of the thing.
I have had a lot of advice on Model Boats Forum regarding the size of motors to install....so much that it will be difficult to make up my mind when the time comes!

As a ' By-the-way ', having been to the water today I was able to take a picture of my carrier/launcher,
made from pipe and plumbing fittings; there are accessories to enable me to cart and launch any of my 5, soon to be six, boats.
