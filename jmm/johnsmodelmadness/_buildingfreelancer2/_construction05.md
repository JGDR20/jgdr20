## Free Lancer 2 ' redesigned '

Trials on the local water indicated that, whilst Free Lancer 2 motored and responded to the helm well, on a tight turn the heel was more than we liked.

Freelancer 2 has a good turn of speed, excellent manouverability, good wave form but excessive heel on turns, probably due to the wooden superstructure raising the C of G.
Most boats heel to a degree and whilst Free Lancer recovered OK, the heel was unrealistic.
I decided that action must be taken !

The solution, very drastic, was a ' Redesign ' involving taking a a panel saw to the model just below the bridge dack !..........
resulting in lowering of the C. of G and losing more than a pound of ' Top hamper '.
At this stage a friend told me that he knew I took great care over building my models and was amazed that I could take a panel saw and ruthlessly ' Decapitate ' one when it was completed !
However having designed the thing I was at liberty to redesign it !

				<blockquote>The boat after radical surgery, with a panel plane !</blockquote>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

Railings, liferafts and ' etceteras ' were recovered, this after using the computer to visualise the outcome of the surgery.

Then I sawed through then removed the superstructure just above the engine room level, that being permanently attached to the hull.

A few days and many hours later the remaining upper works were tailored to fit the fixed part of the superstructure and the whole thing looks as if it was designed that way.........................
a lesson learned and goodbye excessive heel !

![SternViewAsRevised]

Here is the stern view of the revised boatwith the wheelhouse lowered.....after all bits are sometimes added to boats..........so why shouldn't bits be removed ?

After modification, less heel on the turn.......the boat is far more stable altogether.

The ' designer ' is pleased at last !

That really is the end of the ' Journey '..........Many thanks Martin at [Model Boat Mayhem] for the ongoing support, and congratulations on your forums................a feast for model boat enthusiasts.
