There are no bulkheads to obstruct the inboard space, allowing freedom of layout for radio gear and so on.</p>

				<p>The hull form is different to Free Lancer.............the boat is ' Bigger in the bilges ' one might say. This to improve stability.................. In the case of Free Lancer a considerable amount of lead ( from a skip ) was required along the line of the keel to reduce the heel on tight turns, although on test it would recover from 20 degrees or so of heel. This boat will need less ballast and be more stable.</p>

				<p>The skin throughout is of 1/16" ply. PVA adhesive and brass pins are used ( the PVA was bought by the gallon...cheaper that way ! ) and have proven waterproof after a 24 hours immersion test. It is to be hoped that <em>Free Lancer 2</em> never suffers immersion for that length of time ! Just a small amount of curvature ensures that the ply doesn't deflect between supports. The 1/4" overlap is for careful trimming.</p>

Back to boatbuilding, all the pins so far used to fix sheeting have been punched below the ply surface to facilitate later filling.
At this stage, with the hull form established it is a simple matter to drill for the propeller shafts,
the template perched on the stern sheathing in the above picture is used to get the angle
and horizontal location of the shaft correctly placed to fit with the nozzle and rudder post.

Next the sides will be sheeted to the level of the main deck and foredeck,
allowing sufficient bearing for the bulwarks which are inclined inboard at bow and stern.

The lands for attaching the bulwarks have been cleared and angled to provide the correct 'Tumblehome'.
