With the sides sheathed and the boat wrapped in polythene, a dip in the pond gives an idea of the probable ballast reqirement in terms of weight and location.

Hidden in the polythene sheet in the picture is a Stanley smoothing plane.
Added ballast combined with the weight of the batteries and the upper works will bring the hull to the intended waterline.

As this project is scratchbuilt and freelance there is a lot of pleasure to be gained from searching the web for interesting detail to be included in the upper decks and bridge.
The number of sites dedicated to tugs, service vessels and the like is amazing.
Towage companies and shipowners sites have endless information... too much information in fact and the head reels at the scope, facts and illustrations.
Martin Davis's site [Model Boat Mayhem] is a great place for helpful links to useful pages.
