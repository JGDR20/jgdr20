## Radio controlled model boats, power and sail

Currently activities are focussed on building model boats........so a page on the site describes construction of the Rhine Pusher ' Egrete ' from drawings published in Model Boats magazine, a fountain of knowledge for all who enjoy Boats, and in particular model boats.

Back to my activities......................

A recent model boat building project was construction of a freelance model of workboat, aptly named ' Free Lancer ' constructed in wood as you might say, ' All out of my head '.
The step- by- step build is illustrated here: [Click here][BuildingWorkBoat]

### The current project... a static model of a Pilot Cutter

A new project is underway. thinking and scheming has been going at odd moments and now a decision reached...
it will be a sailing vessel based loosely on the legendary pilot cutters.
I have searched the web for images and details and have downloaded many illustrations, some detailed, also a few sketchy images of the lines of a range of past boats as well as replicas currently being built and sailed by enthusiasts here and abroad.
The model is intended to present an impression of these wonderful vessels.

I intend to photograph the build, which will be a static model, as the work progresses, and include the images as I have on other builds,adding a brief commentary as I go.
The page is currently under construction and must be viewed as such!
