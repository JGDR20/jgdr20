## Foreword
( This was written when the book was first published on 2 Floppy 
disks !.....John ) 

I have, over the last few years, had the pleasure of watching Pixie grow, from a 
design concept through to a finished locomotive. this has been thanks to 
occasional personal contact, and largely through the occasional articles 
submitted to MODEL ENGINEER magazine detailing progress to the latest stage.The 
author is a meticulous craftsman, with a well developed and organised workshop, 
each feature being installed as a result of considerable thought. That he has 
chosen to set out this account of his activities, revealing both the triumphs 
and difficulties encountered in the construction, is a tribute to his meticulous 
recording of his work. 

Of all the books that I have read concerning the building of small locomotives, 
this one adopts a novel approach, taking as a starting point the actual workroom 
or other premises which are to be used for the work. Very often this is a facet 
of locomotive building which is neglected; leading to considerable problems 
later. 

I like the attention to detail, the account of the research needed to bring the 
product to fruition, the novel approach to pattern making, and the authors 
somewhat novel approach to gleaning much of the material needed.This is a very 
readable account of the building of a well detailed locomotive and, as 
importantly, the many hints and tips of a practical nature passed for the 
benefit of other constructors by the author. 

One can only applaud his industry in making the volume available in this 
fashion, I for one wish the volume every success.

## Chapter 1
### Choice Of Prototype
### Why Narrow Gauge?

*Choice of prototype. Space, weight and scale considerations. Location of track.
Haulage and handling considerations.*

Narrow gauge locomotives and rolling stock, as we in the United Kingdom know 
them, have a flavour of their own, quite removed from the nature of those of 
standard gauge railways. Historically narrow gauge lines, essentially light 
railways, have been quaint and often slow moving yet, in their own way efficient 
servants of the community. They and their dedicated staff have traditionally 
provided a personal, if somewhat erratic service, perhaps running in fits and 
starts, sometimes even stopping for an individual passenger at a field gate. 
History also records instances where the traveller has been required to assist 
in re-railing a piece of stock or in fetching water for the boiler! 

Narrow gauge lines have a history of running on uneven, occasionally weed 
overgrown track. They take acute bends and steep gradients in their stride, 
rarely travelling at speeds exceeding 20 m.p.h. The locomotives are picturesque, 
often of short wheelbase, sometimes with with small boilers, tall chimneys, 
intricate weather plates and other interesting items of equipment. In some 
instances narrow gauge locomotives are festooned with 'Victoriana' in the form 
of sandpots, polished plumbing and literally all manner of bells and whistles. 
Having said all that, we have to remember that on most continents there are 
narrow gauge (narrower than standard gauge that is) locomotives working over 
hundreds of miles of mountainous and inhospitable countryside. Such for example 
are the metre gauge railways of India and Malaya, and the South African and 
Ecuadorian Railways of 3 foot 6 inch gauge. In this book we concern ourselves 
with the narrower gauges and the smaller locomotives which have come to regarded 
in this country as the 'Norm' for narrow gauge. 

There is a wide range of prototypes from which to make a selection. Firstly 
there are the conventional locomotives, often carrying out the duties of 
standard gauge locomotives over difficult terrain. Then there are tram 
locomotives, which worked in the industrial or urban environment, many of these 
are notable for their shrouded wheels and motion and controlled emissions of 
smoke and steam. They would be designed to be controlled from each end of the 
footplate, also hand and steam brakes would be compulsory. A number of tram 
locomotives were built with vertical boilers, an added touch of interest in 
model form. Vertical boilered locomotive models provide the builder with an 
opportunity to incorporate some previously built essay in model engineering, 
such as a Stuart Turner engine into their model. De Winton locomotives with 
vertical boilers and cylinders were virtually an engine platform with water 
tank, bunkers, reversing lever and brake standard. Inside and outside frame 
configurations were employed, also inside and outside drive, the latter by lay 
shaft and crank. R.A.S Abbot in his book on the topic describes how some 
locomotives carried the chimney directly above the boiler to avoid the formation 
of condensation and some locomotives were fired by sliding the fuel down chutes 
into the firebox located between the frames, plenty of scope here for the 
freelance modelmaker ! In an article in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 163 No.3859 October 
1989, Phil Atkinson gave the reader food for thought in his description of ' 
Coffee pot locomotives ' outshopped from Head Wrightsons Works in the late 
1800's, with their heavily riveted vertical boilers and substantial wheelsets, 
these little locomotives would present a challenge, and a reward for the 
builder. A surprising feature of the locomtive was a one piece, cast iron frame 
incorporating main side members, buffer beams, the fuel bunker, all foot plates 
and the stiffening ribs, the whole described by Phil as a fine piece of the 
Victorian designers, pattern makers and iron founders art. No. 16 by the same 
builder even sports a rudimentary roof although one which would afford little 
protection to the driver ! 

For added spice, builders may turn their attention to innovative locomotives 
such as LOCOMOTIVE NO. 1 of the Listowel & Ballybunnion Railway, straddling an 
early monorail. Double-bogied types such as those of the Festiniog Railway would 
present a challenge, or perhaps the modeller would wish to undertake a model of 
one of the the SHAYS or HEISLERS of the American short lines scene. Ken Swan's 
series on 'KOPPEL' a rack locomotive in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE could prompt 
the modeller to produce, for instance, a model of Locomotive Number 7 on the 
Snowdon Mountain Railway, although track construction would present a major 
challenge. Those seeking a simpler prototype would do well to build the 
locomotive Ross Harrison described commencing in ENGINEERING in MINIATURE, issue 
of September 1982, a convincing model in 5" gauge based upon 'EDWARD THOMAS', 
Kerr Stuart 'Tattoo' Class locomotive built in 1921 for the Corris Railway, 
later moved to the the Talyllin Railway, a model full of atmosphere. 

For something really different the modeller might turn to the locomotives of a 
Dublin Brewery, designed by Samuel Geoghegan. These 1 foot 10 inch gauge 
locomotives with cylinders and motion placed ABOVE the boiler were used in 
conjunction with haulage trucks into which they were hoisted for working the 5 
foot 3 inch gauge. In this role the wheels of the locomotive rested on grooved 
rollers which propelled the trucks. Contractors locomotives make interesting 
prototypes and many model engineers have built 'SWEET PEA', designed along these 
lines by Jack Buckler. Some of these models exhibit remarkable modifications and 
there is scope for innovation. This locomotive would make an ideal test-bed for 
the model engineer who likes to experiment with features of his own design. 
Contractors locomotives provide a range of prototypes suited to modelling and it 
is a salutary thought that narrow gauge locomotives such as the Bagnall 
locomotive 'EXCELSIOR', a delightful little 0-4-0, were employed in much 
industrial construction as well as civil engineering works for railways. 

A series of articles by Martin Evans in MODEL ENGINEER commencing in 1980 
described a free lance narrow gauge 0-4-0 Saddle Tank Locomotive, 'CONWAY'. This 
again was a blow-by-blow description and, as with all Martin Evans designs, 
examples of the completed model have been seen performing credibly on a many 
occasions. 

The modeller fortunate enough to locate the Armley Industrial Museum in Leeds 
can find there the beautifully preserved Hunslett narrow gauge locomotive 
'JACK', resplendent in scarlet livery, lined in yellow and black. Built in 1898 
for employment in a fireclay works near Burton-on Trent, 'JACK' is outside 
framed, has Baguley valve gear and masses of brass and copper in the steam dome 
and plumbing, with brass lubricators mounted on the smokebox. On top of the 
boiler are twin sand boxes and the loco has some nice details such as the hinged 
lights on the weather board and the drain pipes from the cylinders passing 
through the front beam. Running like a Rolls Royce it is a wonderful sight and 
one to make any model engineers pulse skip a beat. 'JACK' featured on the cover 
of MODEL ENGINEER Vol 158, No. 3798 April 1987 and a description of the 
locomotive appeared in that journal of October 1984 

Lest it be thought that narrow gauge locomotives are mainly of simple design 
there are many examples way and beyond 0-4-0 configuration as regards 
complexity. These will present just as much of a challenge as a standard gauge 
locomotive. For example there are the Manning Wardle & Co. 2-6-2 side tank 
locomotives and the 2-4-2, Baldwin, 'LYN' of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. 
('LEW' of this railway is, at the time of writing, being described in a 
construction series for 3 1/2 inch gauge in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE.) For the 
really adventurous constructor there are of course the 2-6-2 + 2-6-2 Garrats of 
the South African and Indian railways. 

Decisions, decisions....! 

The writer's decision to model PIXIE the Kerr Stuart ' Wren' Class locomotive 
KS4260 / 1922 was based upon several factors. First and foremost was the 
impression that the sight of the little locomotive as it coasted into Pages Park 
Station on the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway one spring afternoon. It 
seemed incredible that a locomotive, produced initially for work on the 
installation of a sewer in 1922, should 60 years later be found running like a 
Rolls-Royce and doing useful work in a domestic setting. Enquiries revealed a 
little of the history of the locomotive, the fact that after the completion of 
the Barkingside sewer contract it had for some years worked in the Wilmington 
Road Quarry of Devon County Council, eventually being purchased by the 
Industrial Locomotive Society and brought to Leighton Buzzard in the late 
1960's. The locomotive has an overall length of something over 10 feet, it 
weighs 3 Tons 7 cwt empty, and 4 tons 3 cwt in working order. The inside framed 
locomotive has Hackworth valve gear and is resplendent in an attractive livery 
of black, green and gold. 

Here was a locomotive that was mechanically quite simple for a relative beginner 
to construct, It would be accessible for survey and was in the hands of friendly 
folk who were prepared to assist with provision of information. The railway was 
within 25 miles of home base, so that the survey could be staged over a series 
of visits. Above all, the locomotive had an atmosphere and charm which appeared 
to the writer to convey the very essence of narrow gauge railways. The decision 
has never been regretted and has, over the past ten years, opened up a whole new 
interest in the mechanical engineering of railways and of narrow gauge railways 
in particular. 

At this stage the modeller intending to work in narrow gauge has to come to 
terms with the fact that just as much work will be involved in producing his 
chosen model as in producing one to run on standard gauge. Pixie was ten years 
in the building, through choice. Some things are too good to hurry and although 
one is always keen to get one's first locomotive onto the track, later efforts 
can be savoured, and perhaps greater attention paid to detail. In some instances 
such as for instance if a decision was made to model 'MERDDYN EMRYS', of 
Festiniog Railway fame, far more work could be involved. There could however be 
a saving in unit time in producing duplicate equipment, motion, tanks etc. In 
practice some builders do make locomotives in pairs and professionals make 
batches for just this reason. 

### Size

Although construction of a sizeable standard gauge model locomotive may make 
excessive demands on the capacity of one's workshop and equipment, narrow gauge 
locomotives are generally simpler in design and, at the same scale, work up 
smaller in model form. ( This fact can be used to advantage by the modeller 
'moving-up' to a larger scale). The flavour of work and operations on a narrow 
gauge line can be replicated within a small workshop and in ones own backyard. 
Model engineering activities along narrow gauge lines' provide every opportunity 
for the incorporation into models of the very things that attract us to the 
prototype, to make and handle the artifacts that would otherwise, unless one 
works as a volunteer on a preserved line, be literally beyond reach. It should 
be remembered however that modelled on 5" Gauge quite a small locomotive such as 
PIXIE, at some 10 feet overall, will be more than 25" long in model form and of 
such dry weight that it is beyond one (normal) man's lifting ability! Quite 
apart from the weight of the model the physical size, 25" long x 11.5" wide by 
20" high are dimensions to be reckoned with when it comes to handling in the 
workshop and between shop and track! These details will not daunt the enthusiast 
however and ways and means are discussed later in this book. 

### Scale Considerations

There are many factors to be considered when deciding upon the scale in which to 
model the chosen prototype. Whilst often one reads a statement that ' such and 
such a scale was chosen because of the equipment available on which to machine 
the parts' there is a lot more to be taken into consideration! Even a model of a 
small locomotive like PIXIE requires space for storage, maneuvering from storage 
to the track and general handling for maintenance and overhaul. In the case of 
Pixie it became necessary to build the hoist detailed in chapter xxx to carry 
out these simple exercises in comfort! 

One can comfortably carry out the machining operations for a 5" Gauge narrow 
gauge locomotive on a lathe in the Myford, ' maid of all work' series, or some 
similar equipment. In case of need, one can often obtain assistance with larger 
components from a local engineering works or by enrolling at a local Evening 
Institute. Many trojans work on 7 1/4" Gauge although here the parts, 
particularly the boiler assume relatively massive proportions. The enthusiast 
will tell you that these aspects are offset by the ride-in capability of their 
models and one can see their point of view. Access to a suitable track for 
running a 7 1/4" locomotive is however likely to be beyond the reach of many 
people, depending of course upon geographical location. On the other hand, 3 
1/2" and 5" Gauge tracks are generally accessible, the local club probably 
offers both facilities and one will not require a pantechnicon to get the 
locomotive there. 3 1/2" gauge locomotives will fit easily into the family car 
as will some 5" gauge models, although larger locomotives on this gauge may 
require a purpose-made trailer. Narrow gauge locos for 5" track can be loaded 
into an estate car, and at a pinch can be manhandled by two strong men. Models 
scaled to 5" gauge offer sturdiness of components capable of surviving such 
rigorous handling. There are numerous designs and details available. Over the 
years, blow by blow descriptions of the construction of such models have 
appeared in the model press. Narrow gauge on 3 1/2" track can be ideal for a 
garden railway but for ride-behind fun the larger gauge has more to offer. In 
the case of a model such as Pixie, 2 1/2" to the foot scale on 5" gauge provides 
a stable ride, with a locomotive that has heft, and parts that are definitely 
out of the 'watchmaking' class! At this scale too the locomotive is robust, the 
firehole door whilst small provides a reasonable target for firing on the move 
and the levers and valves are sufficiently large to convey the feeling of the 
real thing in use. 

### Track Location

Of course the ideal track location must be around one's own garden. Few of us 
however, are fortunate enough to have sufficient space at our disposal, 
particularly for anything other than an out-and-back track. Having said that, 
the out-and-back track has its merits. It can be simple, relatively cheap to 
construct and lay, as well as providing a useful test facility. Whilst it would 
be grand to have a railway sweeping round the grounds, there is a lot to be said 
for 50' or so of portable track that can be laid down on the lawn or the terrace 
when required. Such a track avoids problems with landscaping and garden 
maintenance such as weeding and grass cutting. When the urge to steam a 
locomotive arises it is a simple matter to fetch the lengths of track from the 
shed or garage, lay them down, fasten a few fishplates, and be ready to run. One 
length of such track, carried into the workshop, will prove useful when setting 
valves and carrying out routine maintenance. Construction of a suitable track 
system is described and illustrated in a later Chapter. 

The more fortunate may have space available which will permit a complete 
circuit, with perhaps a siding into a storage shed. This is not beyond the 
bounds of a medium sized backyard and one hears of 0-4-0 locomotives happily 
negotiating 6 foot radius curves although it has to be said that the larger the 
radius the better. Certainly a small engine shed could be made to look most 
attractive and its location on the running ground would avoid a lot of effort 
that otherwise has to be expended in handling between steamings. 

### Haulage And Handling Considerations

Where there is sufficient space it is convenient to store the locomotive in the 
workshop. Failing this, perhaps a corner of the garden shed or garage can be set 
aside. It will prove helpful if the loco can be kept stored on a small trolley, 
Pixie's trolley is of Dexion angle, provided with a length of track and some 
stops to immobilise her in transit from the track to store and back. The trolley 
is described in Ch 17. Some splendid trolleys have been described in the model 
press from time to time. The modelmaker who intends to build up a locomotive 
stud, and take locomotives to club meets and similar events will do well to 
construct something similar to facilitate loading into the the car or van. One 
of the writer's acquaintances has a purpose-modified road trailer fitted with 
track on which two sizable locos can sit in transit, secured by bottle screws 
between strong points on the locomotives frames and the trailer body. Tool and 
coal storage is provided in the well of the trailer. The locomotives live on the 
trailer between meets and the trailer is ready for instant coupling to the 
family car, a good incentive to get out and about to meets and rallies. 

As well as trolleys and trailers some ingenious hoists have been described in 
the model press, one hoist was designed to be coupled to the towing ball hitch 
on the back of a car for stability whilst lifting. The hoist used for handling 
Pixie, described later, is used to handle the locomotive in the workshop and at 
the garden track. It could be rendered more mobile by the insertion of splices 
in the leg frame to enable it to be transported by car. If this was done the 
original 'test load', two and a half bags of cement would be called into action 
once again to prove the mechanics. Hoisting a locomotive calls for a 
custom-built spreader bar to ensure that no damage is suffered in the course of 
a lift, and time spent getting the correct balance of the locomotive whilst 
suspended on such a spreader will ensure safety.

## Chapter 2

*Establishing detail. Research. Manufacturers drawings. Commercially available designs. Value of the model press, exhibitions and club membership.*

### Establishing Detail

The amount of research required will depend upon whether the modeller chooses to 
produce an accurate scale model, or a near scale model. In the former case a 
massive amount of detail will be necessary, to the point of the sometimes 
derided ' rivet counting' exercise '. To embark on a scale model of a locomotive 
from 'scratch' is to commit oneself to many months and perhaps years of work. 
For the scale modeller every detail has significance, every modification to the 
original design has be faithfully reproduced and incorporated into the model. 
The problem here is that the components may prove to be too delicate to stand up 
to service on the track and there has to be a temptation towards some judicious 
beefing-up of parts. Fortunately if the choice is a narrow-gauge model on 5 inch 
gauge track the various components will work up to be quite substantial and 
durable in use. 

The near scale modeller whilst perhaps taking a more relaxed approach to detail 
has nevertheless to convey the atmosphere of prototype through the parts that he 
does include. He is fortunate in having the opportunity to make parts a little 
more solidly than they would be in true scale and thus a little less vulnerable 
to damage on the track. As we have said before modelling is a very personal 
process. Whatever the degree of scale accuracy is decided upon, careful research 
is required. The word ' Research ' sounds quite impressive. In fact it really describes a process that 
every enthusiast follows naturally in the course of enjoying his hobby, that of 
ferreting out detail on a topic which he finds interesting. The sources of 
information are many and varied, ranging from contact with individuals having 
personal knowledge of the topic, manufacturers, museum archives, libraries, 
railway sites, Model Engineering Societies and Preservation Societies. Once 
one's mind is set on a particular prototype there seems no end to the sources of 
information. The only problem is that in the back of one's mind there is always 
always the feeling that some source is being overlooked. The modeller may rest 
assured however, if there is some inaccuracy or anachronism, someone with expert 
knowledge will probably put him right at time of the models first public 
appearance! 

### Manufacturers Drawings And Photographs

We may be fortunate enough to have a sight of manufacturers drawings, if not 
directly, at second hand. Many of the books on narrow-gauge railways shew 
illustrations of these drawings which can be worked-up for use as detail in 
constructing a model. Photographs of locomotives in the outshopped state are an 
institution. No manufacturer ' worthy of his salt' would have outshopped a 
locomotive and sent it away to his customer without having it photographed in 
its pristine state. These photographs are worth their weight in gold to the 
enthusiastic model engineer who can enlarge detail and glean useful information 
for model making purposes. Failing works drawings or manufacturers photographs, 
the authors of many of the series of construction articles published in the 
model press base their work and the drawings accompanying the text on detail 
taken from manufacturers drawings. 

Some books such as those on narrow-gauge lines noted in the bibliography 
include, as appendices, quite detailed drawings of the locomotives and stock of 
the lines they describe. When supplemented by detail derived from the 
photographic illustrations, these small scale drawings can provide sufficient 
detail for the model engineer wishing to produce a near scale model. Typical of 
these, and on the face of things an unlikely source book i s ' Narrow Gauge 
Railway Modelling ' by D A Boreham. Intended for workers in 7mm scale this book 
includes nicely produced general assembly drawings of such locomotives as 
Locomotives 1 & 2 of the Festiniog Railway and 'Mary' by W. G. Bagnall as worked 
by Cliffe Hill Granite Company. The book ' The Lynton and Barnstable Railway 
1895-1935' by L.T. Catchpole includes works line drawings of the three Manning 
and Wardle locomotives and the Baldwin which reveal essential detail for the 
modelmaker. 

Over the years some excellent, and generally quite accurate, outline drawings 
have been published in the model railway press devoted to 4mm and similar scale 
modelling. These drawings provide a basis for an excellent model when used in 
conjunction with standard details of parts gleaned from the pages of MODEL 
ENGINEERING and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE and such standard works as LBSCs ' Shop 
Shed and Road ' and Martin Evans ' Manual of Model Steam Locomotive Construction 
'. Whilst in the main these books cater for the modeller working on standard 
gauge, mechanical principles do not vary from those of the narrower gauge. As 
discussed earlier much of narrow-gauge mechanical engineering is of a simpler 
design than that of the big stuff but there is no reason why, within the ' 
innards ' of a narrow gauge locomotive, one should not employ more advanced 
methods. 

### Research

A visit to the local library will reveal a wealth of publications touching upon 
the subject of narrow-gauge railway operations, locomotives and rolling stock. A 
brief perusal of the advertisements in the model press will serve to remind us 
of the considerable number of books available for purchase. A search of the 
stock on the bookstall at the next model railway exhibition will yield a 
surprising amount of information which is specific to narrow gauge. In the 
run-up to commencing a model, it is worthwhile copying or noting for reference 
material likely to be useful when the work begins. Often one encounters 
photographs showing useful detail in the most unlikely places. Newspapers, 
magazines, guide books and holiday advertisements have all yielded useful data 
in their time. The writer with his interest in sketching and drawing decided to 
measure from the prototype, meanwhile enjoying the visits to the line and 
contact with the volunteers working on the stock there. This may not be a 
feasible approach for many and other means of establishing detail become 
imperative. Brochures, postcards, and some posters for the Leighton Buzzard 
Narrow Gauge Railway provided photographs, which were of immense value in 
confirming detail achieved from survey. The modeller will do well to seek out 
similar details of his projected prototype. 

Researching a model can be tremendous fun. Recent research took the writer to an 
industrial museum in the Midlands to meet a voluntary archivist. Working in the 
bowels of the museum this gentleman, a volunteer with years of experience within 
the engineering industry, specific to locomotive design and construction behind 
him, spends his time cataloguing works drawings saved from destruction at the 
time of the demise of an internationally known manufacturer. He has become known 
to many enthusiasts and is constantly called upon to supply information on 
requests from correspondents all over the the world. In fact, so busy are he and 
a colleague, that they cannot publicise their facilities in case excess demand 
should bring their activities to a halt! Perhaps in the course of research the 
reader will be fortunate enough to meet similar kind folk. 

### Commercial Designs

During the past 20 years there have been many series of articles on the 
construction of narrow-gauge locomotives, notable are those on the construction 
of CONWAY, a freelance narrow-gauge 0-4-0 Saddle Tank locomotive for 3 1/2 inch 
gauge by Martin Evans, in MODEL ENGINEER of 1980. Other practical designs are 
the freelance model ' SWEET PEA ' mentioned earlier in this book and described 
in a series of articles in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE. Whilst such designs are 
initially prepared for the benefit of the readers of the journal, commercial 
concerns soon set themselves up to provide the necessary materials and 
particularly castings for featured locomotives. In this way the modeller gains 
the advantage of an economic supply of raw materials and is, should he so wish, 
relieved of the work of producing his own patterns 

The model engineer should not overlook designs for which part, or fully 
machined, sets of parts are available, particularly as these models have been 
built in large numbers and have proved themselves as runners on tracks 
throughout the world. Kits of ready machined parts such as those available from 
Messrs MAXITRACK have served to introduce many modellers to the delights of 
model engineering. Once having assembled a model from a set of parts, production 
and assembly of ones own parts seems just a small step to take. 

### The Model Press, Publications, Exhibitions And Club Membership

As will be evidenced by the frequent references in this book, the writer is an 
avid reader of a number of model engineering publications. These range from 
MODEL ENGINEER and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE to the excellent series of 
publications by such firms as ARGUS BOOKS and THE OAKWOOD PRESS. Magazines 
devoted to specialised topics such as small scale railway modelling have 
information to offer. It is well worth taking time to note articles which 
contain detail which can prove useful at some later date, a note of the magazine 
or source made in the diary or logbook can save hours of searching later. 

Most of the existing narrow gauge railways have a bookshop at the main depot as 
do industrial museums up and down the country. Stocks within these shops often 
contain valuable information for the would-be modeller, most for example have 
some write-up of the history of the line and its equipment, or in the case of 
museums a description of a specific locomotive exhibit, containing valuable 
illustrations. Picture postcards and posters are another source of information 
and with care can be used to supplement surveys and drawings. 

National and Local Exhibitions provide an opportunity for contact with trade 
suppliers, and other enthusiasts who can provide leads on sources of 
information. The models exhibited often reveal useful detail, and contact with 
the producer can assist in extending ones knowledge of methods and techniques. 
There is often a stand where known experts give demonstrations and provide 
advice on problems. Bookstalls at exhibitions can provide a useful source of 
information, on occasions it has been possible to pick up a years back numbers 
of journals for quite reasonable sums, reasonable when one considers the wealth 
of information contained therein. 

Club membership has a great deal to offer, particularly where the newcomer to 
model engineering is concerned. There is never any shortage of know-how or 
advice. Frequently one or other of the members is specialist in or has specific 
knowledge of a particular railway, having perhaps worked on the line or more 
recently done voluntary work in preservation. Club membership may well present 
other advantages such as access to machines and services and sometimes 
discounted prices on materials from a local supplier. Local club programmes 
often include talks and demonstrations by visiting speakers, specialist in some 
branch of model making such as boilermaking, painting and so on, these events 
are particularly beneficial to the beginner.

### Going It Alone

As we have seen there are many drawings available for narrow gauge locomotives, 
quite a number of kits of castings and indeed, even sets of parts for home 
assembly. It is however quite likely that the modeller has a particular 
prototype in mind, one that has fired his imagination, one that brings back fond 
memories from the past, or perhaps a locomotive to which access can be gained. 

Where the prototype is one of the many that have passed on to the ' great engine 
shed in the sky' then some research will be required. Indeed, research of some 
order will be required whatever the reason behind the choice of a specific 
prototype. We are fortunate that the history of steam and steam railways in 
particular has been so thoroughly recorded by many devoted writers over the 
years, these constitute major works and will prompt further reading as a 
particular topic is followed up. 

### Surveying A Prototype

The cover of MODEL ENGINEER Vol 158 No 3795 Feb 1987 illustrates 'Rishra' and 
'Challoner' of the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. The remarks of the 
Editor of MODEL ENGINEER, Ted Jolliffe who took the photograph are apposite. He 
writes,' This shot was taken on one of the best days of last Summer at Pages 
Park Station, home of the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. ' Rishra ' and 
' Challoner ' pose together after double heading a Special Train, a charming 
sight and one which could well cause many modellers to dash to the railway armed 
with camera, ruler and sketch pad' ........ We know the feeling! 

If one is fortunate enough to have access to the chosen prototype there are a 
number of things to consider in achieving sufficient detail for the construction 
of a convincing model. The locomotive may be sited on a preserved line, in a 
museum or may even be standing in derelict condition in a scrap yard. The 
important thing is to secure access. The first step will be an approach to the 
controller of a preserved line, the curator of a museum or the proprietor of a 
scrap yard. Permission to survey the prototype is generally given although there 
may be some stipulations regarding access times and so on. The thing uppermost 
in the minds of those in authority will be that of safety, both that of the 
visitor and those who work the line or run the museum. This is understandable in 
these days when responsibility and the rights of the individual are assuming 
such importance in life. It is essential that any visitor makes his presence 
known to those in charge in order that this safety can be preserved in the case 
of engine, stock or plant movements. 

In the case of a locomotive preserved in a museum, one may be fortunate enough 
to find that drawings already exist, more than likely the curator or some 
enthusiast will have done some research already and will be prepared provide 
valuable information. In the case of a preserved locomotive it is likely that 
the line is in possession of at least some drawings from which copies or at 
least major dimensions may be taken. 

In the case of PIXIE it was decided to make a complete survey, starting from 
scratch as described in this chapter. Where drawings or key dimensions are 
available, a lot of what is described can be omitted but in the interests of 
achieving a model of character it is advisable that, where possible, a visit or 
visits are made to the prototype for the purpose of achieving accuracy, and 
observing details that have either resulted from rebuilding or preservation 
work. Some detail changes are brought about simply by repair of wear and tear, 
or changes in the demands made upon the loco in service. For example, some small 
details such as the loops of tow that are used to lubricate the valve rods on 
PIXIE, the diesel couplers that were mounted for some years, the changes to the 
rear weather plate and the replacement of the riveted tank by one of welded 
construction with imitation rivets have been incorporated in the model to good 
advantage. We did not, however, incorporate the differences between wheels that 
have resulted from refurbishment over the years! 

At an early stage it becomes necessary to decide on a ' base date' for the 
model. In the case of Pixie this was set as the date on which we first saw the 
locomotive. As well as the base date, the state in which the model is to be 
presented has to be determined. It takes a strong character to produce a model 
locomotive in pristine condition and then render it into a weathered condition! 
Mostly, we like to see our models in an outshopped state and not exhibiting the 
ravages of service. I decided to model Pixie as though she had just undergone a 
face-lift in the paint department but incorporating all the detail that I saw 
that magic day when I first saw her glide into Pages Park Station on the 
Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway. 

Having decided on the prototype it is time to start on the survey. I was 
fortunate to have the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway ' on the doorstep '. 
I had visited this line on a number of occasions and been struck by the friendly 
manner of all the volunteers who work the line. Not for nothing has the railway 
won its name as ' The friendly little line'. I gathered all the information I 
could from their publicity leaflets, and obtained some attractive posters, one 
of which showed my chosen prototype PIXIE the Kerr Stuart ' Wrenn ' Class saddle 
tank locomotive, built in 1922. The poster still adorns one wall in the 
workshop. This illustration and the memory of our first encounter acted as a 
spur to my efforts over the years. 

At the Railway I soon established that the volunteers, among them the taxman, 
the accountant, the telecom engineer and a number of other interesting 
characters, were all pleased to help in any way they could. Access to the 
workshop was given by the Controller. Drivers, firemen and other functionaries 
took the greatest of pleasure in responding to my sometimes naive questions. I 
was able to time my visits to coincide with occasions when the locomotive was 
shedded for normal maintenance and repair, and one notable occasion when the 
boiler was to be subjected to inspection and test by the Insurance Inspector. 
Take time to develop a good relationship with the staff of your selected 
prototypes' line then you are sure to be accorded the same privileges. 

Of course you may be fortunate enough to obtain copies of the works drawings 
from the manufacturer, or you may have gleaned sufficient information to build 
your model from your research. In the first case you will only have to scale 
down the detail, in the second you will need to prepare sufficient detail for 
construction planning and parts manufacture. In the case of Pixie sketches were 
produced from site measurements, not finished drawings but simple line drawings 
to be worked from at the various stages of construction. Examples of these 
sketches can be seen in the accompanying illustrations. 

Plan the survey work. You can only make so many measurements in each session! 
Sometimes you will need a friend to hold the tape or direct the torch. You can't 
always bother the locals who are busy with their maintenance and restoration 
tasks. It is helpful to pre-prepare sketches from photographs so that you can 
enter the dimensions as you measure, failing this produce sketches on the spot. 
Bold outline sketches are best, it is difficult to sketch, measure and insert 
dimensions all at the same time. It is also difficult to convey to another 
person just what dimensions you are calling-off, so wherever possible enter the 
numbers yourself. On return to base, and as working sketches are prepared, make 
notes of any dimensions that are missing, these will be the first measurements 
to be taken on the next site visit. Do not be dismayed if on the first visit ( 
or two ) you miss some details, you will find with practice that you become more 
observant, and more inquisitive. 

### Equipment For The Survey

Each individual will have differing ideas on the gear required for the 
preparation of measured details from a prototype. The equipment used by the 
author, whilst varying from visit to visit, included the following items;- 

Clipboard, pencil (s) and paper, eraser, pencil sharpener or knife, measuring 
tape, steel rule, torch and a set square, ( on most occasions the edges of the 
clipboard sufficed) 

Camera and flash equipment, preferably a single lens reflex model although 
todays compact cameras, with their built-in flash and zoom facilities provide 
excellent photographs. Dare we mention spare film! 

Most of these items can be carried in a knapsack or some similar bag, nothing 
too special should be used as it is likely to accumulate its share of steam oil 
or grease! Mention of oil and grease brings to mind the need for a supply of ' 
Swarfega ' or some similar de-greasant, a bottle of water and an old towel. Not 
all loco sheds have supplies of such basic needs! 

### A System Of Working

It is always advisable to phone the site prior to a visit, both to confirm that 
you may have access to the locomotive and to establish where it is to be found 
on the day, also what state it will be in. It is also useful to know how to 
dress for the visit, some days are 'clean' days and some decidedly dirty! 

Now for taking the actual measurements. It is best to start by making simple 
sketches of the key items to be measured in the course of a visit, say a front 
beam, back plate or frame member. It makes good sense to keep groups of details 
on separate sheets, even at the risk of duplicating some detail. This will make 
reference to detail of particular parts of the locomotives easier in the 
workshop when a specific sheet of details can be isolated for reference. This 
also facilitates filing of the results of the survey, speeding the process of 
identifying dimensions. 

Try to make each sketch to the same proportions as the member to be measured, 
later this will be facilitated by the use of photographs in producing sketches 
on which the dimensions can be set out. It is advisable to take running 
dimensions from a datum point thus avoiding inaccuracies due to the build up of 
small differences in measurement. In the absence of a helping hand, running 
dimensions can be taken single-handed by clamping one end of the tape to the 
feature forming the datum, and reading the tape at each point of interest ( 
remembering to pull the tape taut as each reading is taken, and ensuring that it 
is not snagged on some projection! ) Where taking details of groups of items 
such as bolts or rivets these should be sketched and measured, and the running 
dimension taken to a key point in the group. The individual rivet heads or bolts 
positions can then be related to this key point, and set out accordingly when 
interpreting the sketches back at base. At this stage with the tape in position, 
a photograph will reinforce the dimensions being noted. When the time comes to 
translate the detail the photo will serve as a reminder of odd little points 
which whilst clear on site fade in the mind between whiles. Things that are 
easily overlooked are material thicknesses, bolt, nut and washer sizes. Whilst 
measuring the plane surfaces it is also necessary to note such detail as plate 
thicknesses, pipe diameters, bolt and rivet head sizes and shapes. Where there 
are details such as cranked plates and coupling rods, dimensions of offsets have 
to be noted.. Sets in plate, or changes in plane, and similar detail which are 
critical to the overall appearance and ' atmosphere ' of the finished model 
should be noted and ' scrap ' sketches made for future reference. These scrap or 
local details are most useful in interpreting the overall picture presented by 
the dimensioned sketches. Brief notes help too, a note regarding colour, texture 
or material of some feature will save valuable time at a later date. 

### Ongoing Visits

After the first visit it may be possible to mark up dimensions onto sketches 
taken from photographs or from slides, the former by tracing from a large print 
of a subject set upon a light box, alternatively on a sheet of glass or perspex 
placed over some suitable form of illumination such as a table lamp. 
Transparencies can be projected at a suitable size onto a piece of paper taped 
to the workshop wall and tracings made for use on the next visit to site. 
Judicious scaling of the projected picture will ensure that sufficient space is 
available for the insertion of dimensions at site. 

At the commencement of a follow-up visit it is essential that outstanding 
queries are cleared up. This may necessitate further measurement or some 
discussion with a local, be he a curator, or a volunteer in the case of 
preserved locomotives. A point of caution here, enthusiasts can be very helpful 
but.....their memories are tinctured by their personal interests and any two 
taken together may come up with different opinions regarding when such and such 
a detail was modified or a particular feature added. In the course of 
conversations it is worth while listening for local ' intelligence ' such as a 
forthcoming ' shopping ' of the prototype or perhaps a boiler inspection. Visits 
timed to coincide with such events, with permission, will provide opportunities 
for examining the inner workings of the locomotive, the valve chests and boiler 
tube arrangements, blower ring and so on which would otherwise prove difficult 
when the loco is in service. 

When working on the survey it is advisable to visualise how the model parts will 
be constructed, whether they will be machined from castings or fabricated. 
Whilst this does not affect the dimensions needed it does assist when the 
fabrication commences in the workshop. 

### The 'Database'

Information achieved at site will form the basis for some months and in some 
cases, some years of effort in the workshop so that on return to base it becomes 
necessary to store the details from survey in such a manner that they can be 
recovered at will. All rough sketches made at site should be retained, possibly 
in a box file. Photographs and file cards can be stored in boxes and slides 
filed in the containers in which they are returned from processing. It is 
advisable, in order to save time later, to segregate details under various 
headings such as ' Backhead', ' Smokebox' etc. Ideally, general assembly 
photographs will serve to tie the various items together and indicate the 
relationships of the individual subsections. During the course of constructing 
the model of PIXIE more than 180 photographs were taken in the form of 
transparencies and some 100 pages of notes and sketches were assembled. These 
are still retained today and act as a reminder when some adjustment or 
modification becomes necessary. Between visits and when not engaged in making 
parts in the workshop, some redrawing of details can assist in clarifying 
detail. It is advisable always to retain original sketches although they may 
have been superceded by a more recent, perhaps tidier sketch. There is often a 
need to return to the original to recap on some note or sketch made at the site. 
In this context it is advisable to make notes of details that present themselves 
during the survey, Where lock nuts are used, the position of a cotter pin and so 
on, later in the workshop one does not want to attempt feats of memory to 
establish what one saw months or years before. 

### Photographic Records

Now we have digital photography and can wiew the images we take at whatever size 
is required on computer screen. Archiving is a simple matter and referencing 
simpler still. It still pays to take addition trouble to include tape and rules 
to enable sizes to be established back at base and special care over lighting to 
reveal the inner workings of the machanics of our subject. 

Often there are posters and similar material which can yield useful information, 
as well as postcards perhaps, on sale at a kiosk illustrating our subject in 
earlier days. 

The Internet provides a fund of images of virtually every locomotive that ever 
existed, simple to download and readily sizable on our computer, and again 
simple to archive. 

It should always be remembered that permission should be sought to photographon 
site. Safety arrangements have to be observed and also care should be taken 
regarding copyright of images from the web.

### Workshop, Tools And Equipment

This chapter ought really to be entitled ' Tools, equipment and workshop ' 
because, whilst many books on the topic set out initially to describe in some 
detail the workshop facilities required, in practice the first requirement is 
some tools. The next requirement is some mechanical equipment and eventually a 
workshop, or rather a workplace! Of course it is ideal if one has a dedicated 
space in which to work, a place where everything can remain undisturbed between 
sessions, but it is a lucky man indeed who can start with such a space 
available. A great deal of work has been done in what were on the face of 
things, quite unlikely situations, in a first floor flat, in a roof space, 
onboard ship and countless other such awkward or uncomfortable places. At one 
time the writer made models on a fold-down bench sited, of all places, in the 
toilet ! Then followed a move to the loft via. the kitchen table and eventually, 
some years later it became possible to build an extension to the house and set 
up a formal workshop. 

A great deal of useful work can be done simply by using hand tools, small parts 
being turned in an electric drill. Occasional access to a lathe and drill press, 
made possible perhaps by enrollment in an evening class or by ' chatting- up ' 
the maintenance engineer at one's place of work can bring the opportunity to 
progress further in the hobby. Several of the stationary engines which provided 
the basis of the author's model engineering experience were fabricated 
piece-part fashion using such facilities..... ........Maintenance engineers 
often turn out to be steam enthusiasts at heart! 

The pleasure to be obtained from our hobby can be realised in a number of ways. 
One of these revolves around pride in possessing the necessary tools for the 
job, sometimes obtained as a result of some sacrifice such as giving up smoking, 
or forgoing some other pleasure. There is also the satisfaction to be taken from 
achieving something which would normally be considered beyond the scope of the 
simple equipment which we may have acquired. Whilst other delights of model 
engineering have been touched upon earlier in the book, the challenge of 
achieving, what once may have seemed to be if not impossible, extremely 
difficult, using available equipment and facilities still features heavily in 
the enjoyment stakes! 

### Tools

Tools are a joy, however acquired either purchased in pristine condition from a 
first class tool shop or from other sources such as garage or car-boot sales, 
possibly in need of renovation. The tools that give the greatest pleasure are 
often those passed on to us from relatives or friends. Tools may have been 
handed down from departed relatives and considerable pleasure can be obtained as 
using them prompts remembrance.. Use on the current project prompts thoughts of 
the original owner, such as the old tool maker who on his retirement made us a 
present of his micrometer and other measuring tackle. As experience grows the 
modeller will probably design and make some special tools, these are 
particularly precious in meeting an identified need and are special to the 
maker. 

It is important to buy the best tools that can be afforded, they will if 
properly maintained probably outlive us and be passed on to sons (and 
daughters). Where possible, a workshop set of tools should be maintained as 
distinct from the general kit used in the garage and on DIY work about the house 
and garden. When a loan is requested, lend from the general kit! Mainly tools 
are acquired as the need arises although most of us will have to admit to making 
purchases on an impulse, particularly at the magical MODEL ENGINEER EXHIBITION 
where there is the opportunity of making some fantastic purchases. It makes 
sense to go to the exhibition with a shopping list of items necessary to bring 
tool stocks up to standard, it offers a grand opportunity for replacing broken 
small items such as taps and drills. It is very difficult to withstand the urge 
to snap up bargains and indeed often return with such ' bargains ', perhaps 
wondering what prompted the purchase yet secure in the knowledge that they will 
come in useful one day 

### Measuring Tackle And Instruments

Apart from the aforementioned micrometer the following equipment, listed in 
order of aquisition, meets all the requirements of model making on models up to 
5" gauge:- 

Good quality steel rules in 300 and 150 mm lengths, squares of various sizes, 
inside and outside calipers, oddleg caliper, 0-150mm vernier caliper gauge, 
height gauge, mm dial gauge, surface plate ( mine is 250 x 200mm obtained second 
hand ), magnetic stand for dial gauge also various scribers. Although the sizes 
are quoted in millimetres the workshop still boasts a set of Imperial equipment 
and much of the work is carried out in ' dear old ' feet and inches. 

Later additions to the outfit include some inside micrometers, obtained 
secondhand, a centre finder, a wiggler set for edge and centre-finding, pair of 
vee blocks and a huge, ex-WD, caliper, purchased for a song in an open market. A 
dial caliper gauge ( the pride of my life, bought as a bargain at the MODEL 
ENGINEER EXHIBITION ) is in constant use. As model engineers rather than 
engineers, much of our work involves working to fits rather than critical 
dimensions. The dial caliper provides a speedy yet sufficiently accurate means 
of comparing sizes whether internal, external or depth. The current generation 
of digital gauges are of course even more dynamic to use and will prove to be 
worth the ' arm and a leg ' they may cost. The great advantage is that these 
instruments can be zeroed at any dimension and thus directly indicate 
differences between measurements. 

A recent aquisition, a magnetic-based holder for a dial gauge, has proved 
extremely useful. It is used the course of turning, milling and drilling to 
measure tool feeds. With the base set onto the machine bed and the magnet 
actuated, a dial gauge can be set to bear against a table or slide such that the 
travel or depth of feed can be directly read from the gauge as work proceeds. It 
is far easier in some cases to read the gauge thus set-up, than it is to read 
the micrometer dial on the machine. 

### Hand Tools

The number and type of tools that one uses is a very personal thing, excellent 
models are built by some modellers equipped with what could be regarded as the 
absolute minimum of tools. It is preferable as far as possible to have the 
correct tool for the job, sometimes to the extent of 'overkill'! 

Again in the order of aquisition the following tools have permitted the 
production of a series of models up to 5" gauge:- 

An assortment of saws including 'senior' and 'junior' hacksaws and a coping saw. 
Hammers, ball pein, claw and pin, also a builders lump hammer for persuasion of 
heavy sections! An assortment of files and some rasps. A short set of ( 
expensive ) jewelers files have proved invaluable Pliers of assorted shape also 
a pair of steelfixers ' nips ' and two sizes of tin snips, one having curved 
blades. Chisels, punches of various sizes and an ' automatic ' centre punch. A 
wheel brace and an electric drill, later supplemented by the aquisition of a 
high speed mini-drill and variable speed control. A variety of clamps include ' 
Mole ' overlever clamps, 'G' clamps and a range of tool makers clamps. A 
hot-glue gun has proved useful, particularly for locating small or thin parts 
during machining operations! Screwdrivers include the good old ' engineers 
pattern driver, electrical and watchmakers screwdrivers. Several adjustable 
spanners are used,for rough work but for actual work on models only good quality 
open ended, or socket spanners are used. Messrs Proop's ' Doofers ' come in 
useful at many stages. 

Drill bitts have been purchased over the years to the stage where number sizes 
are supported as are Imperial and letter sizes to about 1 / 2" diameter maximum. 
Taps and dies have been purchased as the need has arisen and most sizes from 9 
BA to 1 / 2" are held, together with the necessary stocks and tapholders. 

### Tool Storage

Tools are stored on boards, either wall mounted or, in the case of small tools, 
fixed as riser boards on the back edge of the benches. The location of tools on 
these boards is determined by the place in which they are most often used, chuck 
keys adjacent to the drills, tommy bars adjacent to the mill, small tools 
adjacent to the clean bench and so on. Tools which see only occasional use are 
stored in file trays picked up cheaply in a car boot sale. Portable power tools 
and lathe accessories are sited in cabinets, again wall-mounted, with glass 
doors to ward off the ever present workshop dust. 

### Benches

Bench height is a very personal thing, the vices must be at the right height for 
filing and sawing operations, in the writers case 32 inches from floor level, 
yet for very fine work it is often necessary to have them higher as does a 
watchmaker. This is achieved by having a supplementary worktop which rest on the 
standard bench and can be secured when necessary by clamps, or mounted in the 
vices. 

Within the workshop it seems that one can never have enough benches or worktops. 
Just as it is sometimes said that ' work expands to fill time ', so things 
multiply to fill workspace ! Nearly 2 / 3 rds of the perimeter of the workshop 
is allocated to worktops or benches. Some discipline has to be maintained here, 
one bench is the ' dirty bench ', one the ' clean bench ' and the other the 
light, mobile bench. The first two speak for themselves, although there is a 
need for strong discipline to keep the clean bench, used for electronics and 
fine work, really clean ! The dirty bench is for the heavy work of preparing 
metal for machining. 

The mobile bench is a recent production, made from DEXION angle, it is set to 
match the height of the fixed benchwork and can be used in its own right for 
light fabrication work, or appended to the fixed benches to accomodate overlong 
pieces of work. The castors are of the heavy industrial type and are set so that 
the uprights of the assembly just clear the floor. When any particularly heavy 
task is to be undertaken it is a matter only of a few seconds work to insert 
thin wedges to take the strain off the castors. The bench is used for final 
assembly of clean items and can be sited according to the work in hand, against 
the lathe as a repository for tools between uses or adjacent to the benches as 
required. It is useful to have space to 'park' small tools in the course of 
work, to hand yet not cluttering the available worktop. A particular advantage 
to be gained from a mobile bench is that, sited in the right place in the 
workshop, it provides a base on which a length of portable track can be mounted 
for service work, adjustments to the loco and so on. A short length of 3/4 inch 
plywood is used to bridge between the fixed and mobile benches and access is 
available all round the 'island' so formed. 

### Vices

Vices are mounted on secondary pieces of benchtop which allow their location to 
be changed to suit the work in hand. The heavy ply bases for the vices were 
drilled to template, as were the benchtops and it is a matter of a few minutes 
work to change things around as required whether for heavy or light work, 
working in wood, metal or plastics. As well as the normal duties of holding 
metal for sawing, filing etc. the two metalworking vices mounted in tandem are 
used for folding and bending plate materials. There is a woodworking vice, this 
swivels and has the useful facility of reversible jaws which permit gripping 
material up to 7 inches wide. Cramps include toolmakers, mole, screwclamps as 
used in woodworking and some excellent clamps which whilst intended to be used 
as screw clamps can if supplemented by a 3/4" stock bar be used in clamping 
lengths limited only by the available bar. 'Grippery' is competed by a small 
parts, universal vice built to a design published in MODEL ENGINEER, this is 
invaluable for small part assembly and the investment of the 2 or 3 hours 
expended in its construction has been repaid many times over. 

### Machine Tools

The King of the workshop in these scales is without doubt the Myford 7 series 
lathe. We graduated to this from a Unimat via a very ancient but extremely 
trusty Zyto lathe, purchased second-hand which was used in building a series of 
Stuart Turner stationary engines. The Myford is equipped with 3 and 4 jaw 
chucks, faceplate, and a swiveling vertical table. Drill chucks to 1 / 2" and a 
home- built die holder for the tailstock complete the lathe equipment proper 
although a number of accessories have been built including boring and knurling 
tools, wobblers, height gauges and so on from descriptions in MODEL ENGINEER 
over the years. 

The first exercise with the Myford was the construction of a sensitive drill to 
a design from Messrs Reeves catalogue. The necessary castings and raw metal were 
purchased from Reeves and provided excellent practice in turning, boring and so 
on. The parts worked-up into an extremely accurate piece of workshop equipment 
which allows the use of the smallest number drills without breakages. With small 
number drills it is important that one gets the 'feel' of the drill as it cuts 
metal, particularly at the critical time just before and at break through, the 
Reeves drill provides just that feel. One addition ,in the interests of safety 
was the inclusion of a perspex, ' wrap-around ' guard for the belt drive which 
otherwise is running just inches from the users face in course of work. This 
machine has been replaced in recent years by a 'cheap and cheerful' drill press 
of doubtful ancestry, and recently a small universal milling machine was 
purchased to suplement the armoury. 

A throwback from the days of wooden models is a a small bandsaw. this is 
invaluable for producing templates and for cutting the odd bit of packing 
timber. It can be used for light metal cutting which is of course also carried 
out using a hacksaw and brute force. A 'nibbler' has proved useful in cutting 
thin sheet for cleading and similar purposes. 

### The Workshop Building

Given the opportunity to have a dedicated building for the workshop there are so 
many possibilities that a description would fill another volume. We have been 
fortunate enough to be able to build an extension to the house, brick built, 
properly heated, insulated and lighted, with power and water available. 

The workshop which was described in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 163 No.3853 really is a ' 
quart in a pint pot ' as the Editor described it at that time. The best advice 
stemming from experience must be that one should think of a size, and double it! 
As with all building work, the finished result always seems smaller than the 
drawings indicated, and anyway extra space can always be put to good use until 
filled with that new machine or additional storage shelves. 

A well insulated timber building can be used as a workshop, as can the space at 
the back of the garage, and most of us know model engineers who produce 
excellent work in such places. A covered access from the house is desirable as 
in the depths of winter it takes some strength of character to leave the warmth 
of the house and brave the elements to get to the workshop! In the case of the 
timber building it is essential to insulate the walls AND THE ROOF. The latter 
often being overlooked can be responsible for massive heat loss and consequent 
condensation. The walls should be lined with something smooth to permit ease of 
cleansing and ideally the floor should have heavy lino or tiles to permit 
sweeping, thus simplifying the location of those small parts which insist on 
gravitating to the floor, ( and under the nearest machine or bench ! ) Double 
glazing, or at the least, secondary glazing of any structure is a further weapon 
in the fight against condensation as well as retaining such heat as can be 
introduced by some ' dry ' form of heating. A centrally heated workplace is of 
course a luxury. Low wattage tubular heaters have a lot to offer in the smaller 
or the isolated workshop. A time switch can be a benefit as the heating cycle 
can then be optimised to suit workshop ' hours ' whilst maintaining the gentle 
heat required to preserve tools and equipment. 

### Services

Plenty of power points at bench height are a must. Provided that substantial 
cable is used these can be supplemented by extension leads with multiple outlets 
( switched and fused ). We have a preference for general fluorescent lighting, 
local intensity of light being provided by anglepoise or similar fittings. 
Whilst low voltage lighting is ideal, normal mains voltage equipment has been 
used for many years without problem or accident, of course these lamps whether 
free standing, wall mounted or mobile are properly earthed and never mounted on 
the machines. The use of a circuit breaker is essential where portable power 
tools are used. On the topic of electricity, one of the most useful pieces of 
equipment that I possess is a rather ancient meter, this measures current, 
resistance and other detail to complicated for my ' ken ' but proves invaluable 
in checking lamps, earthing of equipment and the like 

Access to a sink, adjacent to the workshop yet not in it, is a great asset, 
providing for the cooling of metal, scrubbing down prior to soldering and so on. 
A sink which has become too disreputable for normal domestic use is ideal, and 
an old sink is usually accompanied by some old taps, so that the installation 
can be carried out by the model engineer with access to appropriate pipes 
economically and in no time at all ! 

### Ventilation

Many hours are spent in the workshop environment and thought must be given to 
good ventilation. As some of the operations, such as those of machining cast 
iron and gunmetal generate a very fine dust we must look after our lungs. A good 
quality mask will do much to save the respiratory system from attack but the 
quality of the mask and the suitability of the cartridge to the work in hand is 
all-important. 

The writer's workshop is ventilated using a very large, Vent-axia fan bought in a 
car-boot sale, this is mounted in a box INSIDE one of the the fanlights in such 
a way that the fanlight can be opened and closed in the normal fashion for 
general ventilation purposes. When a forced draught is required the fanlight is 
set wide, the fan switched on, and a hinged perspex inner pane is buttoned down 
to blank-off the fanlight opening beside the fan housing. The fan now produces 
anything between a mild breeze and a howling gale. Air circulation is also 
assisted by two smaller fans, as used in cooling computers, set over the lathe 
and the milling machine. These fans which are attached by clamps can be moved 
easily, and as they are brushless can also be used to flush away the fumes from 
any small painting operations carried out in the shop. 

### The Logbook

As a keen diarist some entry is made in the diary each day. At the same time the 
hours spent in the workshop are noted, also the activities. This odd 
quarter-hour or so, each evening is spent noting down details of the way in 
which things have been assembled, screw and fixing sizes and other details that 
will prove useful, both when the time comes to take the model down and 
re-assemble it, and when remaking parts. The information should also prove 
useful to anyone who may own the models in the future. As well as details of 
finished work, part of the entries will be sketches of the next component to be 
fabricated together with a planned sequence of machining operations ( Often in 
the ' heat of the moment t' in the workshop the sequence may be changed but 
brief notes ensure an awareness of critical dimensions and intended secondary 
set-ups ) It is also helpful to note down any items which need to be checked 
when next visiting the prototype. 

It is said that sketch is worth a thousand words, many times now notes have 
disclosed a detail that had slipped the memory......... after all some models 
take many years to build and a lot of detail becomes buried as work proceeds. As 
an example, recently, due to some corrosion around the regulator gland it was 
decided that the mild steel studs and nuts be replaced by new ones from 
stainless steel. A few moments spent with the logbook confirmed that 5BA studs 
and nuts had been used, and not 1 / 8 inch M.E. as they appeared on first 
inspection. So, as the result of a few jottings some years ago, as well as 
valuable time being saved the likelihood of a damaged regulator body was 
avoided. Other notes made include references to articles in MODEL ENGINEER and 
ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE for future use when a particular operation is to be 
tackled. Some notes are reminders, which form a shopping list and ensure that a 
component cant be produced for lack of the raw material or a particular tool, 
say a drill, tap or other such item easily forgotten when at the shop. 

On completion of a model, with reference to the logbook, it is worthwhile to 
prepare a set of cards, 150 x 100 index cards are ideal for the purpose. These 
shew the sequence of erection, fixing and fastening sizes and other detail that 
a future owner may find useful in running and maintaining the model. These form 
something like a simplified workshop manual such as one may have for a motorcar. 
A computer ' buff ' could set up a useful database in which to record a number 
of the details mentioned, although this may not prove so accessible to others at 
a later date.

*Materials. Sources of supply. Organised storage and the scrap box. Modifying 
available materials. An introduction to simple pattern making.* 

### Sources Of Supply

Sourcing of material is an important aspect of model making. The writer makes no 
secret of the fact that a large part of the materials used in modelmaking is 
scavenged from scrap bins and 'Biffa' skips (with permission from the owner of 
course). We have also benefitted from the miscellaneous selections of 
ironmongery to be found at road junctions and similar spots where vehicles, 
waiting for traffic lights to change, shake themselves to pieces. Judging from 
the range of screws, bolts and miscellaneous metal sections one finds, much of 
our countries' transport fleet must be in imminent danger of collapse! 

Much of the benchwork and shelving in the workshop, as well as the lighting 
fixtures and associated wiring have come from skips. Proprietors of the local 
engineering works are very helpful in this respect, to the extent that, knowing 
our interests they set aside any particularly useful items of scrap! Once they 
become aware of ones interest, friends often turn up with interesting bits of 
metal which can yield useful raw materials. There will be however a number of 
materials which have to be purchased and much of these will come from the 
suppliers who advertise in the model press. A good source of materials is the 
advertiser who puts up packs of useful sizes of bar and rod. A selection of 
these bundles forms a good basis for a modelmakers stock. Of course not all the 
materials will have an immediate application in the sizes purchased but a 
hacksaw and some elbow grease work wonders! 

### Organised Storage

It is important to be able to access ones stock quickly and simply. Care in 
segregating materials and storing them in such a fashion that they are not 
damaged in store is just one further facet of the model engineering hobby. It 
makes sense to run ones stock in much the way it would be organised in a 
commercial workshop, noting when stocks are getting low and thus not finding 
oneself in a situation where materials have to be used wastefully to obtain the 
particular section required. 

Containers suitable for storing small parts and materials are available in a 
variety of materials, largely steel and plastic. Often job-lots of containers 
can be purchased at auction. File trays are excellent for the storage of short 
ends of bar, oddments that prove so useful, provided one can lay hands on the 
when the need arises. Different materials can be segregated in such trays, mild 
steel in one, nonferrous in another and so on. A simple wooden or welded steel 
frame allows such a number of trays to be stacked and reduce the uptake of 
space. For smaller items plastic icecream containers are useful, honey jars are 
excellent for small bolts, screws etc. rotate the jar and give it a shake and 
the bolt screw that you seek will pop into view! 

Some simple methods for storing material:- 

Medium length pieces of bar, rod and tube can be stored vertically in racks 
comprising two grillages of steel bar fixed to a wall of the workshop, one to 
locate the bottom of the stock and the other to support the material 3 foot or 
so above floor level. 

Short pieces of these materials can be stored in lengths of plastic drainpipe. 
The pipes can be cemented together and banks of such pipes allow both easy 
access and a quick check on stockholdings. Similar banks constructed from 
wastepipe and conduit will control stocks of small diameter tubing. 

Multiple-draw storage units are available from DIY stores or can easily be 
manufactured in the workshop. Being wall-mounted they save space. Drawers marked 
with their contents will save hours of searching. 

Drills are best stored in racks, simply made from wood blocks, it will save time 
too if tapping and clearance sized drills are stored together with the screwing 
tackle. Draws marked 'Small number drills', 'Small cutting tools', 'Centre 
bitts', 'Unions', 'springs', 'Washers' and so on, used methodically also save 
time and avoid frayed tempers. 

Jars and ice cream containers are useful for storing small offcuts, nuts bolts 
and similar items, labeling saves precious minutes of time which will otherwise 
be expended in searching for an elusive piece! 

When seeking space in which to store tools and materials remember to consider 
the space over, as well as, under that crowded benchwork. With a brick-built 
workshop and in some cases in timber framed buildings quite substantial loads 
can be supported in custom-built shelf frames, suspended from the roof members 
or fixed back to the walls. The shelf frames should be supported in such a way 
that the majority of the loading is applied to the wall fixings in shear, 
vertically downwards at the face of the wall. Shelf units placed strategically 
above the benchwork, leaving adequate working space also permit the installation 
of lighting units below the shelving providing a good working environment below. 

Some of the materials used in the model engineering hobby are quite aggressive, 
some such as acids and certain paints require special storage. These are best 
kept in a metal cabinet, locked if there are 'little people' about the house. 
This is another instance where the same care should be taken over storage as is 
taken in industry. 

### The Scrap Box

The first port of call when seeking materials for a part of the locomotive will 
be the scrap box, or that odd corner of the garage or shed where those bits of 
metal ' that may come in useful one day ' are stored. That day is bound to come, 
and provided we weren't too ruthless the last time we sorted through in the 
pursuit of space, we will find at least a few pieces that can be pressed into 
service in our project. The materials may not be exactly what we need and it 
needs imagination to see how we can use some of the stuff. It may be that, 
rather than providing material for the locomotive proper, some pieces will 
provide the basis for jigs or templates to assist in the construction or 
erection work. Scrap angle steel such as that from an old bedstead whilst being 
virtually ' Monkey metal ' could prove to be useful in the manufacture of an 
erection frame. Dexion angle can be used in mocking-up a driving trolley, scraps 
of plate may be used as the backplate for the jig on which the horn casting will 
be machined and so on. 

A well-organised scrap box is an important asset. Some time spent in dismantling 
a defunct television set, a radio, damaged video tape case or virtually any 
piece of domestic equipment can yield supplies of a range of materials from 
self-tapping screws to sheet metal bracketry. Admittedly the current trend in 
commercial manufacture towards ' throw away ' engineering practice leaves less 
of a recoverable nature, but there is always some small thing worth keeping. 

### Modifying Available Materials

Often material of the section or length required for the current component may 
not be available. With some adjustment either by way of a change of material or 
method something from stock may be brought into service. Re-cycling, sawing down 
angle, splitting tube, using chucking pieces saved from castings as bushes and 
similar dodges can save money and time. Even pieces that were spoiled in some 
previous operation, and probably thrown into the scrap box in disgust can prove 
useful when cleaned-up, cut-up and re-machined. Whilst apparently a wasteful 
process, producing studs by cutting the threaded portion from a bolt can be 
productive in that one finishes up with a stud, and an embryo bolt albeit one of 
much reduced length! Conversely, the small threaded offcut that is saved after a 
bolt has been reduced in length may well be pressed into service as a grub-screw 
in another application. Keep a few containers marked ' Small brass ', ' Small 
steel ' and so on, and you may be surprised how often you find just the piece of 
material that suits the current requirement. 

It is occasionally possible to find alternative uses for items which would 
otherwise be considered as domestic or garden hardware. instances of this are 
small sized hinges which can be reduced for use in a model, studding sold at the 
ironmongers, again for domestic use which can be brought into service as tie 
bolts for securing material for machining in the lathe or milling machine. 
Stores retailing automotive parts sell metal and rubber tube in various sizes 
and gauges also shim brass and steel and a number of fixings which can be put to 
use in models. DIY stores stock a number of standard sections of brass, 
aluminium and plastic which may meet a modelling need at some time. Even the 
local supermarket will stock polishes, scourers and abrasive materials which can 
be used in metal finishing. A number of the shops market spun or pressed metal 
products such as trays, bowl and eggcups, some in stainless steel others in 
brass. The materials and sometimes the geometric shape of these present 
possibilities to the model engineer, an example that springs to mind is that of 
the steam dome cover cut from the bottom of a spun brass vase!. The search for 
alternative and economic sources of material can be quite fun and may, to some 
extent, relieve the boredom of a domestic shopping outing. 

### Simple Pattern Making

There have been many excellent articles, indeed a number of series of articles 
in the model press on the topic of pattern making. The topic is interesting and 
one which, given time, could become all-engrossing. Ones time available for 
model engineering activities is often limited. With such limits there might be 
some reluctance to spend the time and energy required for the manufacture of the 
more intricate pattern work required by a project. In this case two courses 
present themselves. The necessary casting may be obtained, as in the case of the 
horns for Pixie, by modifying some nearly similar, available casting. 
Alternatively one may turn-to and make simple patterns which, whilst probably 
beneath the contempt of the dedicated pattern making modeller, yield castings 
which can, by careful machining, permit the production of the required part. 

Simple patterns may be carved from wood or, in the case of circular work, ' 
horsed ' from plaster. Simple wooden patterns need no further description, as 
long as the resulting castings include the principal detail and enclose the 
outline of the required part, once the casting has been produced only straight 
forward machining operations will be required to produce the required component. 
Of course the amount of machining has to be limited to work that can be carried 
out with the equipment available in the workshop. Firms producing castings have 
readily accepted and cast from my simple patterns. 

Plaster patterns can be simply produced for the most complicated parts and will 
provide the one or two uses required for most model casting needs. Regarding the 
' horsing ' of plaster to produce circular work such as wheels, this is an 
age-old skill yet one which has often been overlooked. The technique which was 
used for the smokebox rings for Pixie involves the preparation of a sheet metal 
template of the required section ( plasterers use galvanised material, but for 
our short-lived requirements any sheet will do ). The template is furnished with 
a pin which can be inserted into a piece of plate, large enough to accommodate 
the required pattern. The plate is very lightly oiled and the oil wiped away to 
leave just a suspicion of greasiness and the plaster laid approximately to the 
required shape. Judicious ' horsing '( scraping ) with the template around the 
pin generates a plaster master which when hard and coated with two or three 
coats of shellac or paint can be used to produce several castings. In each case 
the necessary allowances must be made for shrinkage, and it has to be remembered 
the finished casting will reflect faithfully the standard of finish imparted to 
the pattern.

guides for the model of Pixie

### Getting Started

With a portfolio of dimensioned sketches and a considerable number of 
photographs under the belt it is time to make a start on planning the model. 
This is the time to do some taking-off of materials, not only establishing 
immediate needs but listing and probably budgeting for, the future. Ours is 
fortunately a long term hobby, and there are many facets to each project. Once 
the main equipment has been bought or made or at least a way of accessing 
equipment has been established, perhaps via a local evening class or community 
centre, the materials for a model can be bought in step with progress in making 
the model. This is a major economic ' plus ', bearing in mind the cost of 
materials, particularly the more exotic ones, such as stainless steel and 
phosphor bronze for which there are few serviceable replacements. 

It is decision time once again! Looking through our sketches and visualising the 
model it becomes necessary to determine whether standard castings that 
approximate to those required for the model are to be used or modified, or 
whether parts will be fabricated from raw materials. The alternative, and this 
may be time consuming, is to have castings made from patterns which will be time 
consuming to produce. Fortunately much of this deliberation can be carried out 
away from the workshop, in the lounge whilst others watch the television, or 
during boring business meetings, there is no end to the scope! In practice, a 
lot of thinking can be done in the workshop or garage where the materials can be 
handled and their possibilities pondered. Pixie's chimney was turned from 
reinforcing steel from a building site, the platework once comprised the 
instrument panel on a piece of control equipment, the chassis for the driving 
trolley was in a previous existence part of a steel door, and so on. In many 
instances a considerable amount of work was required to rework the material and 
prepare it for the operations that would transform it into a part of the model. 
Often a whole evening's modelling time was spent in sawing or shaping ' rough 
stuff ' to a stage where marking out and the work of machining proper could be 
commenced. It adds to the pleasure obtained from the hobby to be economic with 
materials and be prepared to do some re-cycling! 

### Pencil And Paper

The scrap pad or the notebook is a vital tool in model engineering. Time spent, 
pencil in hand will yield immense savings in the time required to produce parts 
for a model. No matter what our artistic abilities, as long as WE can understand 
our notes and sketches that is all that really matters! Sketches of the parts 
required for the model, ideally full size, worked-up from our details and 
dimensions, will give us a feeling for their eventual shape, size and ' heft '. 
With a sensible sketch in hand a start can be made on figuring out the material 
requirements, and visualising key operations in producing the part. Some of the 
operations will be those standard operations described so often, and so capably, 
by the expert writers in the model journals. These replicate to a large degree 
the actual methods used in the construction of the prototype. In many instances 
however because of the implications of available equipment or available material 
we have to be our own method engineer and consultant combined, and devise 
original techniques. The methods so arrived at may not of course be completely 
original, modellers have a saying that there is a precedent for everything. 
Whatever we re-invent however will give us immense satisfaction when 
successfully put into practice. 

### Working Details

Whether, or not, to produce scale drawings will depend upon individual 
preference, The writer works from sketches prepared from the site sketches, 
often after making several different sketch views of the item as described 
elsewhere. For detail which is critical mechanically, such as valve gear and 
motion work, measured drawings are made at the drawing board ( Well actually the 
pastry board! ), often twice full size. These can be used in conjunction with 
cut-card components to establish valve events, critical clearances etc. 

The amount of drawings prepared will depend upon one's skill with pencil and 
paper, and indeed on one's particular interests. We all tackle jobs differently. 
In the case of ' Pixie ' many sketches were made, from all viewpoints. After 
some time spent in this way the part can probably be drawn from memory . This is 
very helpful when it comes to the time to decide upon the materials and methods 
to be employed, also in the course of work in the workshop. Some modellers are 
happier cutting metal but even they will have to sort out the overall sizes and 
details to enable the selection of an appropriate piece of stock. Working from 
the dimensions obtained during the survey each part may be sketched, as near to 
model size as possible. Some modellers may prefer to use one of the lap-top 
drawing boards complete with miniature drafting machine, others may even use a 
computer with a CAD programme. The writer prefers to work in sketch form on a 
pad of A4 paper, this can be done virtually anywhere, even in the bath! 

It is worthwhile making a series of sketches of the part in the various stages 
of production. In this way the sequence of operations in producing the part can 
be visualised and suitable chucking or fixing points provided. Choice of a poor 
sequence of operations can make completion of machining difficult or even result 
in the production of a substandard finish. Ideally, once a part is set into a 
chuck or mounted in a fixture it should only be removed once operations critical 
to concentricity or line are completed. Re-chucking a part causes problems, 
especially for newcomers in their early days in the hobby. Turned mandrels are 
often the solution to the problem and the need for these, and suitable jigs to 
hold small parts for finishing operations, will become apparent on paper as each 
stage of production is examined in detail. 

As an aside, a fixture which the model engineer may like to use as a design 
exercise is a means of supporting 3 jaw or 4 jaw chucks, and faceplates OFF the 
lathe. As well as allowing set-ups to be established in comfort on the 
workbench, such a fitting is useful in holding material whilst setting out and 
during milling operations. The lathe manufacturer generally offers as an 
accessory a threaded mandrel replicating the headstock thread and it is a simple 
matter to attach this to a backplate drilled to match the slots on the top table 
of the lathe, the milling machine, drilling machine etc. Make a few sketches, 
dig out the necessary plate from the scrap box, buy, or better still, fabricate 
a replica of the spindle nose. A suitably threaded nosepiece can cut from a 
spare intended for use in the tailstock, leaving a useful No 2 Morse taper 
mandrel which can subsequently be drilled and tapped for use as a backstop when 
machining thin discs in the 3 or 4 jaw chuck. The result, provided care is taken 
to ensure accuracy of the fixture, as well as providing an exercise in 
sketching, simple method engineering and some turning and fabrication work, is a 
most useful piece of workshop equipment. 

### Scaling Dimensions - Scaledness

There will be occasions where small adjustments or a compromise has to be made 
between dimensions established from survey and those to which the model parts 
are eventually prepared. These adjustments may be required to simplify something 
which otherwise would be over complicated to manufacture with the means at one's 
disposal, to overcome erection difficulties or to ensure that model parts are 
sufficiently robust to be durable in service. Where a scale 4" axle may be 
required the writer has no qualms about using the nearest available stock size, 
in this case, to 2 1/2 inch to the foot scale, 0.875 diameter. This is not 
laziness, or a reluctance to spend time on a machining operation, rather it 
constitutes the approach taken in value engineering. Time saved by eliminating 
the machining operation may well be put to better advantage preparing some other 
more critical part. Whilst this approach may not suit the purist, it is one that 
most people will find they can live with ! 

Instances of compromise made in the course of constructing the model of PIXIE 
were increased thickness of the plates used for frames and some thinning of 
parts of the motion. There were one or two other situations such as the axles 
where, as noted above, stock bar was used rather than material turned to scale 
diameter. The amount of adjustments made by the individual will be determined by 
personal preference and standards. At one stage consideration was given to the 
unprototypical move of splitting the smokebox horizontally, making the top half 
removable in order to facilitate access for installing the blast pipe, wet 
header and so on. Even in 2 1/2 " to the foot scale it is difficult to get 
fingers and especially spanners to the fittings for the blower and such items 
within the smokebox. Some thought was given to Martin Evans comments in ' Manual 
of Model Steam Locomotive Construction ' where he recommends split smokeboxes, 
in that instance for 1" scale locomotives. Eventually the decision was taken to 
use a piece of large diameter steel steam pipe, turned to size, and in the event 
after much fiddling and bruised knuckles the exhaust pipes were ' persuaded ' 
into place. The decision has been regretted since however, as the substantial 
exhaust pipes and blower ring make it difficult to sweep the boiler tubes. A 
rebuild would include a split smokebox ! 

### Fabrication vs. Castings

As our working sketches develop we will be better placed to visualise the 
finished part in model form. as our prototype is a narrow gauge locomotive if we 
are working in 2 1/2" to the foot scale we are drawing components which are, 
linearly speaking, approximately 1 / 6th full size. The finished model parts 
will be quite substantial and correspondingly weighty. It may well be that if we 
are constructing a model of an unusual prototype, and one for which there are 
few commercially available part, we may choose to fabricate components rather 
than make patterns for our local foundry. The coupling blocks and weighshaft 
brackets for Pixie were unusual to a degree and it being unlikely that more than 
two uses would be obtained from patterns, these items were fabricated. Such 
castings as were bought-in were cast from simplified patterns or, in the case of 
the horns, were modifications of castings produced commercially for other 
prototypes. Fabrication allows for economic use of material and in some 
instances economical use of available time. Pattern making is a time consuming, 
although enjoyable pastime, offering as it does a change from metal working 
practice and it does provide another most interesting avenue or aspect of 
manufacturing technology to be explored. Where club membership provides contact 
with other enthusiasts it may well prove worthwhile spending time making 
conventional patterns when the use can be shared with fellow members. Equally if 
a batch of locomotives were in course of construction then patterns providing 
multiple casts would be favourite. 

### Models, Mock-Ups ( And Test Pieces )

The mock-up is an essential stage in automotive, aircraft and many types of full 
size engineering.Due to small discrepancies in scaling of parts, or the accuracy 
of our production, it becomes increasingly essential in our model making, . As 
production of our model parts proceeds models ' mock-ups ' help us to ensure 
proper fits in the final erection stage. For ' Pixie ' a card model was made and 
superimposed on the general assembly sketch of the frames and cylinder casting 
to determine acceptable events in the valve settings. A model of the boiler 
fabricated from stout card was used to ensure that the boiler, as detailed, 
could be fitted between the frames. A further model of the saddle tank proved 
the position of the mounting brackets on the boiler, and so on. 

On a larger scale, a dexion angle mock-up was made of the driving trolley to 
ensure a comfortable seating position with access to the controls, this was 
subsequently translated into the trolley described in Ch xx and has proved to be 
safe, stable and comfortable in service. 

Model assemblies are especially important if, as in the case of the model of 
PIXIE, parts are being made from a series of sketches rather than a full set of 
finished drawings. There are however a number of instances such as those quoted 
where details can be proved ' in the round ' in mock up form, a task which would 
account for no little amount of head scratching in the two dimensions of a 
drawing. Apart from the technical reasons calling for the use of mock-ups there 
is a great deal of satisfaction to be obtained from the preview of the finished 
article presented by even the simplest model! 

Where some new material or technique is to be employed, time spent on a test 
piece or pieces is time well spent. instances where tests were performed in the 
production of Pixie were the trial flanging of the mild steel used for the 
sandboxes and the saddle tank, particularly the formation of the joggle sketched 
where the tank plates overlap. Trial rivet formation, used in producing the 
rivets for the main frame angles, a trial pressing of brass sheet between wooden 
formers indicated that the technique could be used in making the steam and 
exhaust pipe covers which have to fit snugly to the steam chests and smokebox. 
Unusually, in the case of these covers the second trial piece was found to be of 
sufficiently good standard to be used in the finished model !

### Jigs And Templates

Jigs will be required to locate parts for some of the operations such as milling 
and silver soldering. Time spent in producing a simple jig will be repaid by the 
ease and speed with which the most difficult operations can be carried out. 
Jigs, used to locate parts in their correct position, do away with the chancy 
set-ups which are sometimes attempted, using odd bits of metal or wire to hold 
pieces for soldering, or the sometimes makeshift clamping arrangements to hold 
metal during machining. A simple jig permits work to be carried out accurately 
with the correct application of cutting force or allows brazing to be done 
whilst avoiding the odd movements whilst the metal is being brought up to heat 
for jointing. 

An example of a simple jig is that used whilst soldering the components of the 
exhaust pipes for Pixie. 

A piece of stock mild steel from the scrap box was marked out to replicate the 
position of the bolts fixing the exhaust pipe flanges to the cylinder casting. 
The key points of the set out were transferred using calipers and scribing lines 
on marking blue. A further piece of mild steel was welded centrally to provide a 
mounting for a bracket which in its turn secured a piece of studding to locate 
the junction piece where the two pipes join. The exhaust pipes passed through 
the flanges and were cut to the correct profile to seat onto the junction block. 
The whole of the jig was oxydised to prevent the flanges becoming soldered solid 
with their supports ! The flange bolts and those securing the two parts of the 
junction block were also oxidised. The exhaust parts were thoroughly cleaned and 
flux was applied before being assembled into the jig. The assembly was made 
using the preprepared bolts. The joints were then made with one heating, sure in 
the knowledge that the flanges of the finished components would match the fixing 
holes and the assembly would seat properly without strain. 

Whilst discussing jigs, ties and packing are worthy of mention. For accuracy, 
jigs must be securely fixed to the bed of a machine. This will be facilitated if 
suitable tie bolts and packings are handy. It is well worthwhile assembling an 
assortment of lengths of studding to match tee-nuts suited to the tee slots in 
the lathe saddle and vertical slide as well as the bed of the milling machine 
and rotary table if available. Time will then be saved when securing work for 
operations such as boring and fly-cutting. Studding for the purpose can be 
purchased relatively cheaply from the trade, tee-slot material can be bought by 
the length for machining in the home workshop. Short offcuts of bar should be 
marked with their size for quick recognition and set aside for use as packings. 
Marking using a punch on the end of the stock will avoid problems caused by the 
local ' upset ' arising from the punching operation. Often trade suppliers sell 
such offcuts by the kilo containing a range of useful sizes which are ideal for 
use as packing pieces. 

Templates were produced for the machining operations on the horn castings, the 
drilling of items such as the steam chest covers, the drillings in the steam 
dome bush, the foundation ring and the cylinder covers. LBSC's advice was 
followed in the course of the platework and plumbing. A stiff wire was bent 
around flanged plates to give the width of plate required. Similarly, wire was 
also used to establish the route of the pipework and when re-straightened gave 
the lengths of pipe required. Templates were made for any offhand turning such 
as that for the cylinder covers, dome, chimney base and so on, ensuring that the 
required geometry was attained. time spent in thinking through jigging 
operations and the provision of templates will be amply repaid in ease of 
operation and the avoidance of scrap.

> Pixie's frames and a start on the motion

### Making A Start

So now the time has come, to make a start on machining parts for the locomotive 
we have so carefully chosen and, on visits to site, measured, photographed and 
generally fussed over! In the workshop it will be necessary to make constant 
referance to the database, A plastic folder will hold and preserve the measured 
sketches from survey and our sketches pertaining to the parts to be tackled. A 
sheet of perspex in front of a striplight can be used for viewing transparencies 
which are clipped in place using butterfly clips. It also makes sense to provide 
some means of retaining photographs of the relevant pieces so that they can be 
viewed without being handled with ' workshop hands '. A piece of ply with some 
criss-cross tapes as used to hold letters in an hotel foyer will enable the 
photos currently in use to be displayed on the workshop wall. 

Whilst your subcontractor is casting the wheels from your patterns it is a good 
thing to make a start on the frames. Handling the raw steel for a 5 inch gauge 
locomotive gives a good impression of the eventual size and ' heft' of the 
finished frames. Our supplier came up with a length of ' Black steel '. This has 
an extremely tough surface and is quite difficult to work. Luckily, in this case 
, a friend undertook to surface-grind the material and it came back shining 
bright with the hard crust removed. It can prove helpful to carry a small file 
with you when you visit your supplier, if you are in any doubt about the 
workability of materials, a few strokes of the file ( on the metal! ) will tell 
a great deal. 

Regarding thickness of frame material, whilst this may be accurately scaled from 
the prototype it may prove advantagous to beef-up the frames somewhat. Those on 
Pixie are from material which after surface grinding worked up to just over 5 / 
32 inch thick which is in line with Martin Evan's recommendations for 5 inch 
gauge locomotives in his ' Manual of Model Steam Locomotive Construction' 

### Marking-Out

The first and perhaps the most critical operation is that of marking-out. The 
tools for use in marking out frames are basic, a square, a clearly marked steel 
rule, a good true straight edge and a sharp scriber ( the latter two items can 
be home produced ). If a marking die which comes as a laquer to be applied by 
brush is used, the coating thus formed can, with care, be scribed lightly to 
make an impression without actually marking the steel. Remarkably the lines thus 
scribed can be ' felt ' using the tip of a sharp centre punch and will guide the 
punch to points of intersection where a punchmark is needed. An automatic punch 
which can be adjusted to make various depths of indentation and accommodate 
differing surface hardnesses is a useful tool. The blue can be left on the metal 
until all necessary machining is completed then wiped away with a rag soaked in 
methylated spirit. Where heat is generated whilst the blue is on metal the marks 
may require some stronger treatment such as a rub with emery cloth or wire wool. 

Marking-out is best carried out using running dimensions, as used in the survey, 
to mark stations along the frames. Running dimensions are taken from one datum 
in each case and avoid build-up of dimensional errors and consequent innaccuracy 
likely to be encountered where a series of discrete dimensions are used. The 
square is used ( from a true edge of the frame steel ) to mark perpendiculars 
and then dividers or a calipers to set up offsets from the base line. Perhaps it 
goes without saying that the initial set-out should be checked for errors, it 
would be a pity to spoil valuable metal and waste valuable time by errors in 
setting out. 

Care must be taken at this stage to establish the centreline of the axles in 
their running position, both vertically and longitudinally, centre pops either 
side of the eventual position of the horn openings will provide a means of 
establishing the axle position and determining the cylinder location, 
inclination and so on when the actual centre will have been machined away. 

### Cutting Metal

Frame steel usually requires cutting to both length and width, a hard job but 
one made easier by rotating the hacksaw blade through 90 degrees in the frame 
and mounting the frame material in the vice together with a stock bar to act as 
a guide.This substantial stock bar inserted into the jaws behind the frame steel 
acts as both a guide for the saw and a stiffener retaining the long materials 
Aword here about the number of teeth on the hacksaw blade, and the blade 
tension, good quality blades generallybear a lael indicatingthe thickness of 
metal they are designed to cut. Selection of the correct number of tethmakes all 
the difference to tthe ease, or otherwise of the tsk in hand. Once the blade has 
been brought to initial tension about three complete turns of the thumbscrew 
generally suffices to set the correct blade tension. incorrect tension can be 
recognised when a cut starts townder from the ' straight and narrow '. One last 
thought on technique, for years we will have been tutored to use the forefinger 
of the hand gripping the handle pointed forward, ' to guide the cut ' in the 
case of a wood saw. This action courts disaster in the case of the hacksaw, as 
the finger is liable to be the first point of contact with raw mtall in the case 
of blade breakage ! Long cuts such as those required for the frame profiles give 
time to think out the next move as well as providing some exercise to counteract 
some of the less energetic workshop activities! With the nett length and width 
established the frames can be cut to profile. A fairly recent alternative to all 
this hard work is offered by the trade, in the form of laser cut frames. There 
is an added bonus in this approach as the supplier will spot most of the holes 
ready for drilling. Accounts in the model press have been extremely 
complimentary about the prompt an acurate service offered by the one or two 
lazer-cutting specialists. 

The front and back plates follow, again sawn to shape. Where shapes such as 
those required on the front plate are required, these can be produced by chain 
drilling and subsequent sawing. The profile of the frame members can be tidied 
up by draw filing and all is then set for detailed marking out of holes 
positions for rivets, horns and similar details. The side frame members should 
be bolted together at this stage using countersunk headed bolts (countersunk to 
allow the material to be layed flat on the bench for marking out, and more 
importantly flat on the bed of the drilling and milling machines during 
subsequent operations ) 

At this stage the key lines of the motionwork should be established, for this 
purpose the frames may be coated in marking fluid from behind the front plate to 
the line of the back axle or some stout paper glued in place. The first line 
will be that of the axis of the cylinder which will be set to coincide with the 
centre of the driving axle at its running position. This line established, the 
location of the cylinder block can be set out and the position of the slide bar 
indicated. The motion plate fixing holes can now be spotted with the motion 
plate normal to the slide bars. The critical angle of between the axis of the 
cylinder and the top of the steam chest can be measured and a template prepared 
for use in setting up that casting for machining at a later stage. All this is 
done using dimensions taken during the site survey. Later the critical sizes of 
the connecting rods, the valve rods and the piston rods will be established. 

### A Jig For The Wheel Centres

At an early stage in the marking operation it is well worthwhile taking time out 
to make a simple jig to the dimensions of the wheel centres. This jig can be 
used to mark the wheel centres on the frames, to locate the wheel bearings and 
to replicate these centres exactly when making the coupling rods. Having set out 
the wheel centres and drilled pilot holes in the jig, it should be hardened and 
set it aside for future use. 

### Drilling The Frames

With all holes marked out and punched they can be spotted accurately using a 
centre bitt. This is followed by drilling using a succession of bitts up to the 
required, final size. Any slight innaccuracies can be corrected at an 
intermediate stage by drawing wrongly placed holes by centre-punching the edge 
of the hole on the edge to which the drill bitt has to be drawn during one of 
the intermediate drilling stages. Often the correct procedure for drilling 
holes, that of using a series of drills up to the finished size of hole, is 
omitted. Where this procedure is followed the opportunity for correcting the 
occasional wrongly positioned hole is forfeited,also the finished hole, unless 
reamed, is likely to be oversized.. On frames of this size it will be advisable 
to add further bolts to hold the frames together as work proceeds. 

Horn locations can be spotted and opened out by drilling and sawing, finishing 
with a file or by milling. With only two pairs of horns to cater for in the case 
of an 0-4-0 filing is not too arduous a process!. 

### Frame Angles

Whilst standard mild steel angle was used for the frame angles they were trued 
up by milling along one outer face to render them ' die square' to ensure that 
once they had been rivetted into position, the joints between frame members came 
up square. The angles were rivetted to the frames taking care that the top of 
the angle steel was quite flush with the top of the frame members. 

### Buffer Beam And Drag Beam

These were cut from the same material as the frames, somewhat overscale but 
substantial. The positions of the holes for rivets were spotted through from the 
frame angles whilst the whole assembly, frames and beams were held together by 
instrument makers clamps. The actual erection / assembly process was carried out 
on the bed of the lathe to ensure absulute accuracy of plane. On PIXIE as 
distinct from many standard gauge locomotives, the head of all rivets on the 
beams are countersunk. This was replicated on Pixie as were the rivet heads 
described earlier. There are a number of holes in the beams which give witness 
to various modifications made during service, although surveyed these were 
ignored at this stage but will be incorporated later to add to the authenticity 
of the model. 

### Frame Stays

The frame stays on PIXIE are castings, these are reproduced by fabrication to 
save the time which would otherwise have been spent in making patterns. The 
flanges and fillets were shaped, pinned and held together with wire during 
silver soldering. Having learned the technique,silver solder is generally used 
to join items where strength is required. A word here about silver soldering. 
When first starting model engineering great difficulty was experienced in 
obtaining sound, clean joints.Fortunately however, a friend arranged for a brief 
training session with a dear old ' Gent ' in the local engineering works. He 
emphasized the importance of degreasing the materials to be joined, and the need 
for an adequate source of heat as well as the conservation of this heat by 
strategically placed firebricks. " Watch the flux," he said, " When it 
liquifies, touch the solder to the metal and see it ' flash ' into the joint! " 
Among other tips which he passed on in the course of the brief session was that 
of making small centre pop marks on surfaces to be joined. The slight raising 
about the pop mark ensures a minute space between the two parts being joined 
into which the molten solder is drawn by capilliary action. The solder always 
flows towards the hottest component in the joint, a point which will prove of 
assistance when making a difficult joint. For pickle, follow Ted Jolliffe's 
advice in MODEL ENGINEER and use a solution of citric acid crystals in water. 
This is generally as effective as acid pickle and far safer to have about the 
workshop and safer in disposal. The crystals can be obtained in any shop 
specialising in home brewing equipment. 

Many narrow gauge locomotives have distinctive frame details, in the case of 
PIXIE it is the stiffening angles at the top of the side frames, attached by 
prominent, large diameter rivets. Having had difficulty in the past with forming 
rivets to any degree of consistency, and, realising that the results achieved 
here would greatly effect the final appearance of the locomotive, it was decided 
to fabricate the rivets.The formed end and shank of the rivets were turned from 
mild steel rod. The formed end was held in place using a conventional ' Snap ' 
whilst the shank was peened into a countersink formed in the dummy cone head. In 
the case of the ' rivets used to fix spreaders between the frames, these were in 
fact bolts with their heads turned to rivet profile. The cone head was made 
seperately, tapped to suit the thread on the shank and the fixing was made by 
tightening head using a specially made socket spanner, furnished with a pin 
which registered with a hole in the cone. A miniature tommy bar assisted in the 
tightening process and prior to final assembly the threads were annointed with 
locktite ' screwfix '. Elswhere on the frames, such as at the angles connecting 
the beams with frame members, standard black iron rivets were used, the shanks 
being peened into countersunk holes in heads, again produced seperately but 
drilled and countersunk rather than tapped. on completion of the peening 
processs, the ends of the shanks were and filed flush with the face of the ' 
heads ' 

### Horns

The axles on PIXIE run in heavy, sprung axleboxes, riding in cast horns. 
Consultation with Peter, a mine of information, at that time major domo at 
Messrs Kennion, in Hertford, revealed that some gunmetal castings, which they 
held in stock, would provide suitably shaped material which with further 
additions by silver soldering and subsequent machining could be made to 
replicate those on the full size locomotive. These operations were carried out, 
prior to the aquisition of a milling machine, on the lathe using a simple jig to 
assist in work holding. It seems that we amateurs do not make enough use of jigs 
and fittings, so much a feature of full-size practice. Where we need two similar 
components, and especially where there are four or more items then construction 
of a simple jig is well worthwhile, not the least from the safety aspect. Record 
has it that, in the course of machining materials for an earlier locomotive, one 
part flew out of a makeshift attachment and left the workshop through a ( 
fortunately open ) window. Jigs and fittings may take time, they can frequently 
be fabricated from scrap, and set aside, can often be re-used, albeit with some 
modification, for further work of a similar nature. Some tasks simply cannot be 
done without jigs or fittings, for example, to attempt turning a wheelset to 
size without a suitable mandrel would result in failure. Many other jobs will 
benefit from the time and thought employed in producing similar simple tools. 

At this stage a start was made on machining the horns, the worst of the rough 
texture of the casting having been removed by filing, the outside face of each 
was cleaned up by facing cuts made using this tool with the horn mounted in the 
four-jaw chuck. A tungsten carbide tipped tool is kept specially for such 
operations, it is a rugged tool produced for a lathe much more substantial than 
the Myford. It is set on packing blocks under the holder intended to retain 
tools in the Myford ' boat ' nd is capable of giving castings big licks, 
provided that is that they are securely fixed! The flat face produced in this 
fashion was then used as a datum whilst bringing the castings to finished 
thickness. Centrelines were established and the axlebox openings milled to 
slightly less thaan drawing size, some work with a fine file squared up the 
radiussed internal corners left from the milling operation. It was now necessary 
to solder onto the bottom of each horn a flange piece for later attachment of 
the hornstay. A jig was made to facilitate the final machining of the horns, it 
consisted of a backplate which could be mounted on the vertical slide ( those 
with a milling machine can of course use a similar jig ), fitted with a pad of 
steel representing the axlebox and having a cover plate which in effect formed a 
flange retaining the horn in position. Each horn in turn was set onto the jig 
whilst the bolting face of the horn was machined back by the thickness of the 
main frame members. The horns were then reversed on the jig and a small diameter 
end mill used to tidy up the back faces, around the fillets. Each horn was filed 
to shape and drilled, again on the jig, for the bolts which secure it to the 
frames. These bolts must have the heads thinned down. Although the slight recess 
in the back of the wheels provides ample clearance with the axles in their 
running position it has to be remembered that the completed wheel sets have to 
be assembled onto the frames and full-sized heads would prohibit this. 

### Equalisation

Consideration was given to making working springing. It was decided however to 
use the simple suspension achieved by the use of a hard rubber block as adopted 
on ' Sweet Pea'. Dummy springs were milled from brass block, these were enclosed 
in a fabricated band of mild steel and the whole drilled with a clearance hole 
for the tie rods which are screwed into the axleboxes. In practice the 
rudimentary springing arrangement serves the purpose of keeping all four wheels 
in contact with the track, at least on my track, described later, which is 
portable and can thus be packed to a good level when being set out in the 
garden. The spring mounting brackets were machine from the solid, again by 
milling in the lathe. 

### On Milling

Considerable amounts of milling work can be carried out in the lathe. To obtain 
the best results it is worth investing in a substantial vertical slide, 
preferably one incorporating a swivel action. Lateral support for the vertical 
slide can be taken from the tailstock quill and for heavy work the slide can be 
packed up from the top slide. Even without a vertical slide, a lot of useful 
milling can be done on materials either secured to the topslide using steel 
packings and strong clamps or in the case of smaller items clamped in the lathe 
tool holder. A range of end milling cutters and slot drills will prove useful in 
forthcoming operations. Contact with a local engineering works may yield a 
supply of used cutters which although past their useful life in the course of 
rigourous production work can prove useful in the amateur workshop. 

As a result of the ' crick in the neck ' resulting from time spent viewing the 
milling cutter at work on material held in a vice on the vertical slide, that 
the decision was made to purchase a milling machine! A visit to the Model 
Engineering Exhibition afforded an opportunity to compare machines, and prices. 
Fortunately for the model engineer the exhibitors often make special offers on 
equipment and tools at the exhibition , and many are prepared to quote a special 
price if approached. For the occasional light machining that I was 
contemplating, a imported machine appeared to fill the bill, and as the price 
reached after some discussion, and comparison with other suppliers, was within 
my budget one was duly purchased. 

With care in mounting the work, controlled application of cutting force, the use 
of sharp tools and other simple precautions the machine has proved to be a good 
investment. I also use it in woodworking, for grooving, routing and so on. It is 
invaluable as in the construction of hollow masts for model yachts, and similar 
tasks.The collet chuck is essential in achieving rigidity by reducing the 
projection of the quill from within the head of the machine. In the absence of 
an autolock chuck it is advisable to ' key ' cutters into the collets to avoid 
draw-out of the bitt during the cutting operation. As in all milling operations 
on such light machines it is important to avoid step milling, or moving the 
material being machined in the direction of rotation of the cutter, with the 
tendency of the cutter to climb onto the work. Either of these actions whilst 
using a light machine are likely to result in snatch with the possibility of 
damaged tools or worse! . Purchase of the milling machine called for a rotary 
table and a kit of parts or completed table which has proved quite adequate for 
the task is marketted by an advertiser in MODEL ENGINEER. Purchase in the 
completed form, saved valuable time which I could spend in model engineering, 
this saving more than outweighed the extra cost of a fabricated table. The table 
has been a great help in many instances from the finishing of valve spindle 
forks to simple dividing. When rounding ends of connecting rods and similar 
operations it is important to hold the work securely, and to rotate the work 
against the rotation of the cutter, failure to observe this rule can result in 
snatch and possibly injury. 

### Axleboxes

The axleboxes were made in two stages, a phosphor bronze bar sufficiently long 
to yield four individual axleboxes was machined to a tee-shaped section, the 
main stem of the tee, being a few thou' wider than the horn openings. The limbs 
of the tee formed one pair of flanges. The axleboxes were parted off using a 
slitting saw on a simple mandril in the three jaw chuck. A further phosphor 
bronze plate was then prepared to form the second, inside flange of each box 
This method of construction whilst, on the face of things appearing laborious, 
permits a good fit to be simply achieved in the next operation, that of filing 
to an individual fit in each hornblock and ensuring a good slide fit between the 
cheeks of the hornblock. The wearing surface so formed was filed slightly convex 
to avoid binding when the axleboxes move as the rubber springing blocks become 
compressed as the locomotive rides innacuracies in the track. The second flange 
face was now fixed into position using countersunk screws. Each axlebox was next 
drilled and bored to suit the silver steel used for axles, oilways were cut in 
each bore and the lubrication holes conveying oill to the axle and to the 
axleboxehorn surfaces were then drilled. 

### Wheels

The wheel castings were in grey cast iron, and remarkably free from casting sand 
which, if not removed, can quickly take the edge off tools. The castings were 
mounted in the four jaw and the back face turned until the wheel thickness was 
.03 inch more than the required finished thickness of the wheel at the boss. At 
this stage the recess in the back of the wheel, noted during the survey, was 
machined. This recess provides clearance for the heads of the bolts retaining 
the horns in the frames. With the back turned to profile the central hole in 
each wheel was drilled, first with a centre bitt then using successively larger 
bitts to the stage where it could be reamed to final size. 

A plate mandrel was now built from materials from the scrapbox, a short length 
of 1 inch diameter rod and a disc of mild steel slightly smaller in diameter 
than the flange dimension of the wheels. The rod formed a stout chucking piece 
to be gripped in the three jaw and was set to protrude through the plate in 
order to provide a mounting pin for the reamed wheel bores. The mandril having 
been turned true its outer face was lightly relieved so that the wheels would 
bear only around the edge. Care was taken to avoid any fillet at the root of the 
pin, which would have prevented the wheel casting seating properly. The mounting 
pin was drilled and tapped, using only first and second taps, and slit so that, 
when a bolt was inserted and tightened to the extent of the thread, the wheel 
casting would be firmly located and prevented from revolving under the force of 
the cutting tool.ith some wheel patterns the existence of a through hole, or the 
space between spokes may allow the insertion of a stud to further prevent the 
wheel turning on the mandril. After the mandril was inserted in the three-jaw a 
reference mark was punched on the rim coincident with the centre of No. 1 Jaw. 
During the following operations a watch was kept on this to ensure that it had 
not moved. The mandril was not disturbed until further work on all the wheels 
was finished. The mandril has now joined the various jigs, collets and templates 
retained for future use. 

Each wheel in turn was mounted on the mandril, face outwards, for the flange to 
be turned and the tread coned. The old chestnut that coning allows for 
differential travel of wheels on a curve has often been debated, whether it does 
or not it certainly assists in maintaining an 0-4-0 centred on the track and may 
well reduce the tendency of the locomotive to yaw. Here we are reminded of 
report of the Board of Trade Inspector, Captain H W Tyler on the Talyllin 
Railway of September 1866 regarding the 'horizontal oscillation' of the one 
locomotive available to steam the line. 0-4-0 locomotives, particularly those 
with short wheelbase and substantial overhangs are likely to 'oscillate' and any 
means which may help to reduce this tendency is welcome. Recent reports in MODEL 
ENGINEER describe the free running of coned wheels compared with those having 
parallel treads when set to ' freewheel ' down a curved gradient, another item 
of food for thought. Coning completed, the radius between the tread and flange 
was turned using a tool ground to the correct form, the flanges were rounded by 
filing, (using a file with a proper handle ) and the chamfer put onto the edge 
of the tread using a sharp tool. Prior to removing each wheel from the mandril, 
the retaining bolt was removed and a final light cut was taken over the boss. A 
line was then lightly scribed across the centre of the wheel and the boss for 
use in locating the crankpin holes. In order to drill these holes, accurately 
located and perpendicular to the face of the wheel, each of the wheels were 
supported on two parallel pieces of stock bar in the drilling machine. A 
hardened drilling jig with an accurately located guide hole was located onto a 
fitted steel pin, set into the bore of the wheel and clamped into position with 
reference to the lines scribed whilst the wheel was on the mandril. Each hole 
was then drilled in the drill press and subsequently reamed to suit the 
crankpin, the reaming operation being completed on the same setup. 

### Axles

It was convenient to use silver steel for the axles, as discussed earlier the 
stock size selected approximated to the scale dimension. The axles were sawn 
slightly over length then, after turning to nett length, centres were formed in 
each end for subsequent turning operations. PIXIE has plain axles with just two 
shoulders, one bearing against the back of the axlebox, locating the axle 
transversely, the other acting as a spacer bears against the back the wheel. The 
shoulders and bearing surfaces were turned and, after re-touching the tools with 
a stone, brought to a fine finish. As the wheels were to be fixed using 
retaining fluid, the axle seatings were machined to leave a full thou' of 
clearance within the reamed bore of the wheels. Later the joints would be 
further secured by pins pressed into holes drilled half in the wheel casting and 
half in the axle 

### Crankpins

Crankpins are of silver steel with turned shoulders to determine the length of 
projection. Here a slight departure from prototype was made, the outer end was 
drilled and tapped to permit a separate retaining flange to be screwed into 
place. In the case of the model Pixie this permitted the marine type bearings to 
be made in one piece with a dummy joint face as described later. In service the 
heads are secured by a touch of retaining fluid on the screw as it is turned 
home into the crankpin. The crankpins are secured by pins pressed into holes 
drilled half in the wheels and half in the crankpins. This is particularly 
important in the case of the crankpins on the rear wheels, to maintain the truth 
of the return crank setting. 

### Quartering

A variety of methods for quartering wheels have been described in MODEL ENGINEER 
over the years and choice must be a personal thing. The wheels for Pixie were 
quartered using twin plate templates accurately squared-up as a pair, bolted 
together, and holes drilled and reamed at the axle centres and crankpin 
positions. Holes were drilled at each corner of the plates for tie bolts used to 
drive the wheels into position on the axles. These plates were used in 
conjunction with a turned stub-centre of the same diameter as the wheel bore 
mounted in the tailstock Jacobs chuck. The centre was located in the tailstock 
chuck to facilitate access to the tie nuts in the next operation. The crankpins 
were first fitted into the wheels, using LOCKTITE, the bond being reinforced by 
a pin fitted into a hole drilled half in the crankpin and half in the wheel 
casting. One wheel of each pair was set onto its axle using locktite and the 
joint allowed to cure. The axle with the one wheel ( and with axleboxes 
installed!) was then positioned within the ' jacking frame ' formed by the two 
templates and the four jacking screws. The previously turned centres in the 
axles engaged on the point of a standard lathe centre at the headstock whilst 
the tailstock centre was engaged into the previously machined stub centre. At 
this stage the loose wheel, whilst supported by the stub centre had its bore 
slightly engaged on the axle end. The bottom edge of each of the templates was 
packed up, on a common bearing plate, to ensure they remainded correctly aligned 
in the next operation, that of feeding the wheel into place on the axle. The 
exposed bearing surface of the axle where the wheel was to seat was annointed 
with LOCKTITE as far as the shoulder and the nuts on the tie rods were quickly 
tightened, taking a few turns on each in rotation. The wheel was thus 
transferred from the stub centre into its correct location against the shoulder 
on the axles. Accurate quartering was ensured as the crankpins were correctly 
located by the plate templates which were retained in position by the carefully 
levelled packings. Once the LOCKTITE had cured each wheel was secured onto its 
axle by a pin, half in the wheel and half in the axle. 

On reflection the work could have been simplified by using a smaller centre 
slipped into the tailstock sleeve, this would have supported the axle without 
the need for the roduction of a stub centre. Whilst the first described method 
worked satisfactorily, it is typical of the model engineering hobby that 
improvements, or at least modifications of method occur in the course of an 
operation. This is one of the reasons that the journals devoted to model 
engineering are so valuable, they form the forum for the transfer of ideas and 
new improved methods and are akin to the commercial concerns research and 
development department!

### Coupling Rods And Bearings

' PIXIE ' has round-section coupling rods terminating in marine bearings at each 
end. The coupling rods for ' Pixie ' are made from lengths of silver steel, 
shouldered and entered into the bolting flanges at each end. These joints were 
brazed and the faces cleaned up. The bearings were simulated on ' Pixie 'using 
blocks milled from mild steel incorporating the profile of the prototype 
castings. Each block is scribed deeply to represent the joint between the two 
parts of the bearing and each crankpin hole is fitted with a pressed-in phosphor 
bronze bush. The length of the coupling rods was checked against the wheel 
centre template made earlier. Small adjustments were required at this stage, due 
no doubt to minor differences in dimension at each joint. Adjustment was 
achieved by turning-off the inner ends of the bearing blocks in the four-jaw 
chuck. To complete each assembly, matching keeper plates were filed to shape, 
clamped in place on the coupling rod ends together with the bearing blocks and 
the whole assembly was then drilled for bolting. mm size bolts were found to be 
very near to the required diameter and these were used, the heads being turned 
to the shape of those on ' PIXIE '. The thread ends were turned away and the 
bolts drilled for split pins. Oil cups are fitted to each bearing block. For ' 
Pixie ' these were machined from brass hexagonal material, which provided the 
flats by which the cup is screwed into the block. A small form tool ground up 
from a slip of toolsteel ensured the same 'antique' profile to each cup. The 
cups are topped off by a threaded cap screwed into place, these were reproduced 
by turning down the heads of BA bolts and knurling the periphery of the 
resulting head. It was noted at the time of the first survey that any missing 
caps were replaced by corks, as yet no caps have gone missing from Pixie so this 
has not been necessary! Each of the upper bearing bolts has a turned groove 
coincident with the oil cup to allow lubricant to penetrate to the bearing 
surfaces. 

### Brake Hangers And Blocks

On ' PIXIE ', braking arrangements are simple in the extreme, there being only 
two blocks acting on the front of the rear wheels. The brake hangers are pieces 
of bar drilled for fixing to the frames, for the brake block pivot pins and 
attachment to the brake rod. The brake blocks we r e cut from a ring of mild 
steel turned to match the wheel section internally and externally to a section 
which could be milled to provide the hanger slot. The hangers pivot on 
shouldered studs, captive in the frames and backed up by large square washers. 
The pivot pins securing the blocks to the hangers are fitted with split pins. 

### Oilboxes

Four brass 'trays' or reservoirs for axlebox lubricating oil 
are mounted on the stiffening angles. The reservoirs and their hinged lids were 
milled from some anony mous brass from the scrap box, probably parts of 
electical switchgear dismantled in the ongoing ' salvage and alternative uses 
campaign ! Rubber tubing forming minute pipes conveying oil to the bearing 
surfaces of the axleboxes was obtained from a suppl i er of laboratory 
equipment, a useful source of speciality items such as rubber and plastic tube. 
The pipes are attached to small diameter copper pipes silver soldered into the 
oil trays. The feed to the bearings is via similar copper bends which are solde 
red into the axlebox castings. Old fashioned fluffy wire pipe cleaners pushed 
into these bends stems the flow of oil to ensure a constant flow of the 
necessary lubrication at the critical points. 

### Lubricator And Mounting Plate

PIXIE has a mechanical lubricator mounted on a steel plate fixed using two bolts 
through the right hand frame angle. On the model this is replaced by a 
proprietary lubricator from Norman Spinks. The lubricator was seen in an 
advertisement, catching the eye because it incorporates roller clutches rather 
than a ratchet and pawl mechanism, this allows an infinately adjustable stroke. 
The oil case is not too unlike that on the prototype, except that it lacks an 
oil level gauge. On Pixie, as on the prototype, the drive is taken via. a small 
diameter rod clamped to the valve rod, adjustment to the flow being achieved in 
the model form by selecting one or other of the holes in the pump actuating 
lever. The geometry of the action can be adjusted by nuts set on a threaded 
portion of the actuat ing rod. When first seen PIXIE was carrying diesel 
coupling blocks, and, as this is how she was to be recorded, diesel coupling 
blocks were next on the agenda. The dimensions from my survey were set out in 
sketch form and the scrap box yielded the majority of the small pieces of mild 
steel required for fabrication. Access to TIG welding equipment provided the 
opportunity to assemble the parts ' in the square ' and a session with the angle 
grinder, used offhand, introduced the necessary geometry. A study of the 
prototype front plate revealed the fact that a variety of attachments had been 
made during the life of the loco but currently the blocks are attached by 4 
large diameter bolts, these are replicated by BA bolts. The coupling pins were 
turned fom scraps of mild steel rod. These were cross-drilled whilst clamped 
onto a vee-block. A line was scribed on the periphery of the head, a centre 
finder was used to scribe a diameter coinciding with this line. The centre of 
the cross hole was marked with a punch. The pin with the diameter set vertical 
was clamped in a vee block and a pointed wiggler used to locate the punch mark 
below the centre bit in the drill press. An overlever clamp remains on the drill 
press table at all times providing a simple means of retaining material and jigs 
during drilling operations. The fact that the clamp is ' resident ' avoids 
situations where one might otherwise be tempted to ' take a chance ' by holding 
something for a one-off drilling operation, putting ones fingers in jeopary at 
the time of the drill breaking through when snatch is liable to take place. 

### Footplates, Support Brackets And Angles

Two support brackets were fabricated from plate and angle steel, these are 
important as they support the weight of the bunkers. They are rivetted back to 
the main frames using dummy rivets as previously described. The rails are 
sections of angle rivetted to the main frames and the drawbeam at footplate 
level, those supporting the outer plates being at a lower level than for the 
centre plate. The centre footplate is slotted for the damper handle and provided 
with a cranked angle which engages in the handle to provide several settings of 
the damper opening. There is also a checkout for the drain pipe from the water 
gauge. The rail which trims the outer footplates is cut and bent to form a curve 
matching that of the bunker later mounted above it. PIXIE'S footplates are 
replicated in the model by stainless steel plates which are bolted to the angles 
and rails. 

### Finishing Touches To The Frames

On top of each of the frame stiffening angles are mounting blocks on which are 
seated the bearing flanges on the boiler. On the prototype the brackets are 
fabricated from steel angle, these are reproduced in the model although to 
ensure that the boiler would sit true to level within the frames, final 
machining to height was was left until the boiler could be offered up into 
position and the appropriate dimension established. Cutouts were required in the 
stay immediately behind the boiler, these provide clearance for blowdown valves, 
sited just above the foundation ring. Details not to be found on the full-size 
locomotive are the holes for dumping rods or pins which allow the ashpan to be 
dropped in case of emergency. Whilst the downward movement of the ashpan is 
restricted, there is still sufficient room for the grate to drop and the fire to 
disperse in the event of the pins having to be pulled in case of emergency These 
details just about c omplete the frames. Of course detail varies from loco to 
loco and there is a lot of enjoyment to be obtained from identifying details for 
inclusion in ones model. It may be that a particular prototype has been modified 
at some time in its life, something added, a piece of plate fixed at a 
potential crack position or some other ' adjustment ' made in service. For 
example, in the case of PIXIE there are some plates bolted to the front of the 
weatherboard where at some stage the angles have been cut and subsequently 
rejoined. These are yet to be incorporated in the model. It is well worth while 
researching such detail which will go a long way to improving the authentic 
atmosphere of the finished model. On PIXIE there is a small piece of plate 
attached to the front frame member, this provides a purchase for the bolting 
attachment of the drain cock return spring. Small details such as this which 
were perhaps an afterthought on the part of the designer, or an innovation on 
the part of a restorer, help to promote the atmosphere so beloved of the narrow 
gauge enthusiast.

Pistons and piston rods.*

### Smokebox Saddle

The smokebox saddle is a simple casting, produced from a rudimentary pattern 
which governed the profile with allowances for shrinkage but incorporating no 
fine detail. The casting was clamped to the topslide and the bolting faces were 
machined using a fly cutting tool. This useful tool simply produced in the home 
workshop comprises a substantial section of 2 1/2" diameter bar with a drilled 
hole for a circular tool and a grub screw set in the perimeter to enable the 
toolsteel to be set at the correct angle. The mass of metal comprising the body 
of the tool when CHAPTER NINE gripped in the three jaw chuck serves to induce a 
'flywheel' action reducing the effect of the intermittent cutting, a feature of 
flycutting operations. in order to increase the versatility of the attachment it 
is provided with three further holes which match the centres of the tapped holes 
in the faceplate on the milling machine quill. This arrangement is always used 
when heavy cutting / planing operations are carried out in the mill. 

The seating for the smokebox and the small rebate which conceals the joint 
between the saddle and the smokebox were fly-cut whilst the saddle was fastened 
to the vertical slide, set parallel with the axis of the lathe. When setting a 
fly cutting tool to radius it is essential to remember that too small a radius 
will result in metal being cut away from the depth of the concavity, i.e. with 
too great a rise on the chord. Cutting should be started with the tool set to a 
slightly larger radius than that finally required, the tool being adjusted 
inwards, slowly reducing the radius of the cut until the finished radius is 
achieved! This needs a little thought but a few lines on a piece of paper will 
soon verify the facts, and may save a valuable casting from destruction! 

On completion of the machining operations the small gussets which stiffen the 
bolting flanges on PIXIE were silver soldered into position, leaving an generous 
fillet of solder to replicate those on the casting. At this stage a template was 
prepared for the location of the cylinder / frame fixing bolts The centre line 
of the cylinder was transferred to this template and the template set aside for 
later use. 

### Cylinders

The cylinder castings were made from simple wooden patterns which followed the 
main outline of the pieces. In view of the writer's limitations in the pattern 
making department, it had been decided that such items as seatings for the valve 
spindle and piston glands would be added after the main machining operations had 
been carried out. First the top face of the casting was fly cut to the correct 
inclination. This angle was determined from a trial set out in marking blue on 
the frame, using the dimensions from survey and the template previously 
prepared. As well as providing a plane surface to assist in setting out this 
face would later determine the correct angle for boring the cylinder. The next 
operation was that of machining the steam chest. PIXIE has the steam chest 
integral with the cylinder casting, and this called for some massive excavations 
in the model casting ! A new term was added to the vocabulary at this stage. 
Conversation with a ' real ' engineer evinced a description of an operation 
known as ' hogging-out '. This elegant term describes the process of making 
multiple drilled holes within the area which would eventually become the steam 
chest cavity in the casting, before finally the remaining few pieces of metal 
were milled out, using an end mill, to leave an accurate cavity. This procedure 
was duly followed and the resulting steam chests proved to be acceptably 
accurate. 

Having cleaned up the perimeter of the steam chest, attention was then turned to 
boring the cylinders. This was carried out with the castings secured to the 
topslide using straps of stock material in conjunction with suitable packings 
and tie bolts to retain the casting securely during the fairly substantial cuts 
of the boring operation. A word of warning...... unless ties such as used in 
this instance are set absolutely vertical, relative to the topslide, with, in 
this case tapered packings properly anchored into position to provide a firm 
purchase, they may loosen in the course of boring, with dire results. The 
tendency is, due to the cutting effort applied together with vibration in the 
system, for the tie bolts to loosen as they assume a position normal to the 
topslide and the tee-nuts therein. At this stage the cross travel of the saddle 
must be locked by tightening the clamp nut. On my lathe I have fitted a short 
lever here to enable me to exert stronger pressure on the clamp bolt without the 
need to use a spanner. 

Once lined with the axis of the lathe and with the correct inclination 
determined by the previously fly cut face, the ties checked and the cross-slide 
secured against movement, a start was made on drilling for the piston rod. PIXIE 
only has one cylinder cover on the front end of the cylinder, the piston-rod 
passing through a gland on the the closed end of the casting. Drilling for the 
piston rod was done using bitts held in a headstock-mounted drill chuck. This 
operation was started using an end mill to provide a flat land on which the 
centre bitt could bear without being deflected, after the centre bit a 
succession of changes of drill size, up to clearance size for the rod, ensured a 
correctly located and accurately sized hole. The hole was not reamed because 
reaming to finished size can, in this instance, when the gland nut is inserted, 
form what is in effect a 'self locking clutch'. Any misalignment of two reamed 
holes occurring in the course of taking-up the gland causing the piston-rod to 
bind. 

The cylinder bore was cut using a specially made, short, stiff boring tool set 
up in the four jaw chuck which in this instance was used as a boring head. On 
the Myford this required some thought. Finally reference to, would you believe, 
a page by ' Geometer ' in the 6th September 1962 issue of MODEL ENGINEER 
provided the solution ! Two pieces of 1/4" plate were cut and inserted between 
the jaws. This allowed the boring tool to be moved laterally across the axis of 
the machine, within the central hole in the chuck, by the amount required to 
bring the bore to finished size. The metal plates ensured that at all positions 
of the tool it was still supported by all four jaws. A proper boring head would 
have simplified the operation but, bearing in mind the few occasions on which 
such a tool would be used, budgetary considerations determined that other 
accessories were more important. 

In machining bores which are to have a cylinder cover at one end only it is 
necessary to guard against producing a bell-mouthed bore. This is best achieved 
by bringing the bore nearly to finished size then taking only very fine 
finishing cuts. LBSC called this ' taking the spring out of the tool '. 

Cylinder boring completed, the writer encountered a piece in MODEL ENGINEER by 
Keith Wilson relating to the profile of cylinder bores. Given the benefit of 
Keith's experience earlier in the course of building Pixie the cylinder bores 
would have been made according to his ' words and music '. 

Next the position of the ports was established and the milling machine brought 
into play to cut them. These were not the working ports, as the port faces were 
to be in stainless as described earlier. They were cut within the outline of the 
eventual port positions to a depth which would permit the steam ways to 
intercept within the metal between the bottom of the steam chest and the 
cylinder bore. The steam inlet and the exhaust passages from the steam chest 
terminate on the top face of the cylinder block where the flanged pipes seat. 
These passages were drilled from the bolting face of the cylinder block and 
were, after the vertical parts of the passages had been drilled and swarf 
cleared from the holes, subsequently sealed by small turned and threaded plugs 
with slotted heads similar to grubscrews. The plugs were anointed with liquid 
gasket prior to being screwed home. The slotted heads of the plugs enabled 
insertion using a screwdriver and were of course concealed between the cylinder 
casting and the frame after erection. No excuses are offered for the use of 
liquid gasket. Joints do not need to be taken-up too tightly, the synthetic 
rubber hardens as it cures, excess is easily stripped away with a sharp knife, 
and a good seal results each time. This technique may not be in line with the 
practice adopted in the prototype but I feel sure that, had Engineers of yore 
been given access to liquid gasket, they would have used it. Indeed it is 
interesting to ponder, given the range of materials available to us today, what 
the Trevithics and Stephensons would have selected for their constructions were 
they here to make the choice ! 

The passages between the valve chest and the cylinder ends were drilled in the 
drill press, care being taken to achieve the correct inclination by packing and 
clamping to the drill table. First the open end of the cylinder was prepared 
with the bevel which allows steam to pass into the cylinder, this was done by 
filing , using a scrap of brass to shield the bore should the file slip. As well 
as permitting the passage of steam in service, this bevel allows the hole 
positions to be spotted with a fine punch to ensure that the smallest centre 
bitt can be started correctly. LBSC's tip on grinding the drill bitts used to 
drill the channels with one lip wider than the other to enable a broken bitt to 
be extracted is a winner, as was proved in the process ! There is nothing quite 
like the panic that one experiences when a drill or a tap breaks in an expensive 
casting, possibly the more valuable because a lot of time has been spent working 
on that casting up to the stage at which the breakage occurs. I suppose as a 
last resort spark erosion could be used but fortunately thanks to LBSC this has 
not yet been necessary. 

The inclination of the passage from the port to to the blind end of the cylinder 
was such that the holes could be drilled using an extended drill from the steam 
chest. An extended drill was necessary to avoid the drill chuck coming into 
contact with the bolting face of the steam chest. Extended drills can be simply 
fabricated by grinding a stepped joint on the drill shank, cutting a matching 
step on a suitably sized rod, applying flux, binding with soft iron wire and 
then silver soldering the two together. A collection of various sizes of drill 
treated in this fashion will build up as work proceeds and provide a useful 
armoury for future use. 

It had already been decided that, as the valve events of the model would in the 
early stages, prove to be somewhat tentative, the valve port faces would be made 
replaceable. Stainless steel was used for the faces and this proved to be simple 
to machine to the required degree of accuracy as it could be set up flat on the 
bed of the milling machine. Those without access to a mill could equally well 
machine the piece on the vertical slide. Final fixing was carried out within the 
steam chest bedding the stainless steel onto ARALDITE and securing the plate 
using purpose made, stainless steel countersunk screws into tapped holes in the 
bottom of the steam chest. In the event that subsequent modification to the 
porting may be required, the ARALDITE bond could be broken down by local 
application of heat. 

Flanges were prepared for the inlet and exhaust pipes. These were used to locate 
the drilled and tapped holes for their fixing onto the top of the cylinder 
casting, these were then set aside for assembly onto their respective pipes in 
due course. 

### Cylinder Covers

Having bored the cylinders and prepared the steam passages, the next step was to 
produce the cylinder covers, in the case of PIXIE these are of fairly 
substantial section with a nice domed centre. Machining this centre called for a 
lot of knob twiddling, a thoroughly enjoyable business. Achieving the correct 
profile was aided by the production, on the drawing board, of a card template 
which could be applied to check the profile between bouts of twiddling. 
Experience has shown that such profiled surfaces generally turn out to be less 
than spectacular due to a conservative tendency on the part of the machinist, 
reluctant to take those last few cuts that would make all the difference to the 
form of the piece. This springs from the memory of those ' last few cuts ' taken 
in the past which have resulted in a scrapped part and lots of rework ! The use 
of a template as described promotes the development of the striking shapes which 
are a feature of, and provide much of the charm of, the narrow gauge locomotive. 

A glance through any of the books which describe the motive power employed by 
the various narrow gauge and light railways evidences the fact that engineers in 
the heyday of steam were quite happy to spend money on ornamentation which would 
be frowned upon by the ' value engineering ' oriented designer of today. 

The covers were mounted in the three-jaw and the spigot prepared a good fit in 
the cylinder. The spigot was carefully filed away to provide a clear steamway 
to, and from, the steam passage. On a previous locomotive this step had been 
omitted and only remembered when on trial with air, when unbelievably there was 
no action on switching on the air supply. this was of course simply rectified, 
once the cause of the problem had been identified, although at the cost of 
unbolting the cylinder covers and breaking the then carefully made gaskets (that 
was in the days b.i.g, before instant gasket). Drilling for the studs followed 
using a template from thin plate material. The hole positions were transferred 
from the cover clamped into position and then the first hole was drilled and 
tapped to allow the insertion of a stud to immobilise the cover during the 
subsequent drilling of the remainder of the holes. The use of a template whilst 
apparently laborious is a worthwhile precaution as otherwise although the holes 
for the studs can be set out on the cover and transferred to the cylinder, with 
a gunmetal on gunmetal joint slip can easily occur. Again harking back to a 
previous model, the draughtsman had drawn equally spaced studs although with the 
cover located as drawing, one of the studs would have coincided with the 
position of one of the steam passages, small errors like this sometimes slip 
into details and are worth watching for. One cannot help but wonder what is the 
effect on the modeller following instructions in a periodical when he reads an 
announcement such as ' we regret that owing to a printers error in our last 
issue etc. etc.!' Perhaps its advisable to work a few issues in arrears in which 
case printers errors will have been accounted for by the time work commences on 
a particular part. In the same vein one magazine, now defunct, published an 
apology some 16 installments into a series on building a particular model, a 
note to the effect that they had lost touch with the writer and were seeking 
someone to complete the series! This must have had disastrous results ! 

### Steam Chest Covers

Next came the preparation of the steam chest covers. This called for a template 
which was duly produced from a scrap of mild steel. The template was used to 
drill each cover plate in turn, including the small tapped holes for the metal 
threads used to break the gasket joint when access was required to the valve 
chest for maintenance purposes on full size PIXIE. 

Once the cover plates were drilled the template was again used to locate the 
tapped holes in the cylinders, one hole being first drilled and tapped and a 
bolt inserted to secure the template against displacement whilst the remainder 
of the holes were spotted through. PIXIE has a union set in the right hand cover 
providing a take-off for a pipe to a steam chest pressure gauge, this was 
produced from a chucking piece of material from the scrap box. 

The studs securing the steam chest cover are, on PIXIE, set out uniformly about 
the centre line of the cover. At each end is a small bolt, set into a tapped 
hole on the centre line. These bolts serve the important purpose of enabling the 
steam chest / cover joint to be broken when carrying out adjustments to valve 
settings. It was a delight at the time that the covers were required to be 
removed to be able to slacken off the lock nuts on these small easing bolts at 
the ends of the cover, then to break the cylinder/cylinder cover joint by 
screwing down the bolts. Although on Pixie are they are only 8 BA. they did the 
job famously. Those old engineers certainly knew their stuff ! 

### Glands

Seatings for the valve rod gland and tail cover on each cylinder casting were 
milled and shaped from bar stock. They were then silver soldered into place on 
the cylinder casting, correct location being ensured by the use of short lengths 
of carbon salvaged from the bushes of a vacuum cleaner, turned to a push fit in 
each assembly. The carbon resists the solder whilst retaining the correct 
location and is a good example of the recycling activities which form a part of 
the writer's modelling activities! A good fillet of solder was formed at each 
joint to emulate those on the prototype casting. After the soldering operation 
each gland was faced up true to the main body of the casting. 

The glands for the valve rods were turned up as circular, flanged bushes prior 
to being sawn and filed to the required shape. The body of the piston-rod gland 
is interesting, incorporating as it does the seating for the slide bar. 
Production of the body involved a considerable amount of hand-work, carried out 
once the the hole for the rod had been drilled and counter bored for the gland. 
The piston rod gland has an oilway for lubrication and is adjusted by two 
shouldered studs as is that for the valve rod. Rather than use conventional 
packings in the glands, ' O ' rings are preferred as these provide tightness 
whilst causing minimum friction between the parts. 

A nice little detail seen in service is an oil-soaked length of tow which is 
tied to the easing bolt on the valve chest cover and looped around the valve rod 
to provide lubrication. Very practical, and a useful bit of ' colour ' to assist 
with the narrow gauge image ! 

### Pistons And Rods

Pistons are turned from gunmetal, the piston blanks being mounted in the three 
jaw, the holes for the rods drilled and tapped with a 1 / 4 in M.E Thread. The 
thread was cut away using a 1 / 4 inch diameter D-bitt for half of the piston 
thickness to allow the piston rod to be drawn into position by its thread in the 
later operation of uniting the two parts. 

Piston rods of silver steel were set into a simple collet in the three jaw. 
These collets are home produced from suitably sized slugs of metal by drilling 
and reaming to the finished diameter of the spindle or rod to be gripped. After 
marking by centre punch at No. 1 jaw to ensure accurate re-location the collets 
are then slit with a razor saw. As work progresses a number of useful collets 
accumulate and are be stored with the tooling ready for re-use as the occasion 
arises. 

The thread for the pistons was cut with extreme care, using an M.E. die and 
ensuring that at all times the die stock was firmly supported square to the axis 
of the rod by the nose of the tailstock chuck. A tailstock-mounted die holder is 
of great assistance in such work and can be manufactured in the home workshop 
from a proprietary mandrel and some offcuts of round bar. A secondary bush which 
can be set into the space for the die, and which permits longer adjustment 
screws to pass, allows the use of smaller sizes of die within the main sliding 
die holder. 

With the rod set in the collet within the three jaw, the ends of the rods were 
lightly centre drilled prior to oil being placed on their threads and into the 
the tapped holes in the pistons. The pistons, gripped in a hand protected by 
rag, were then screwed onto the rods, care being taken that the plain portion of 
the rod entered well into the smooth, ' D-bitted ' part of the hole. Once the 
pistons were secured in this fashion the tailstock centre was engaged in the 
small centre and the pistons turned to finished diameter with reference to each 
cylinder bore. Each piston was then marked to ensure subsequent matching of the 
sets. It is helpful if a uniform system of marking is followed, centre-pops on 
an unimportant surface will suffice, say one pop for items on the right side of 
the loco and two on the left, looking forward from the footplate, or perhaps 
simpler still one pop for one side, and no pops for the other ! 

With each piston assembly still mounted in the collet and supported by the 
tailstock centre, grooves for ' O ' rings were machined using a parting-off 
tool. Grooves for these rings must be produced to the sizes recommended by the 
makers, this being critical to achieving a sound seal whilst reducing frictions 
to a minimum. The edges of pistons and grooves should always be 'broken' using a 
fine file, to avoid damage to the rings as they are installed. 

On final assembly, the piston rods are retained in the crosshead bushes by 
wedges passing through slots in both parts. In the case of Pixie these wedges 
are, in fact, bolts with the heads filed to simulate the ends of wedges. Holes 
for these simulated wedges were not drilled until their position could be 
accurately located at the time of trial assembly of the engines. Builders may 
wish to replicate the full size arrangement which may call for slotting the 
piston rod and crosshead and providing appropriate cotters and wedges.

gear. Valve setting. Brake column.*

### Motion Plate

The motion plates are of course a handed pair, those on PIXIE are quite 
conventional and those for Pixie were produced by cutting plate to the required 
profile. Then the flange for fixing to the frame was attached by silver 
soldering. The lugs which support the trailing end of the slide bars were 
soldered into place at the same heating. Drilling the holes for the slide bar 
fixing bolt was left until final erection. The motion plate was trimmed with a 
half round fillet on the front face, simulating the detail on the prototype, 
this was attached using soft solder. For the purpose of trial assemblies the 
slide bar was be held in place using a toolmakers clamp. The location of the 
motion plate and thus the position of the fixing holes in the frames is best 
established at the time of setting out the motion work. 

### Slide Bars

Each engine on ' PIXIE ' has a single slide bar the front end of which takes 
support from the body of the piston rod gland on the back of the cylinder 
casting. The trailing end is bolted to a bracket on the bottom of the motion 
plate. The slide bar itself is a piece of profiled steel, in the case of Pixie 
ground gauge plate. This was milled to shape and the fixing holes and 
countersunk lubrication holes drilled in conventional fashion in the drill 
press. 

### Crossheads

On PIXIE the crossheads are substantial steel boxes, assembled around the slide 
bars. Lining each box is a set of slippers, so shaped as to remain captive once 
the crosshead assembly is bolted up. The box is fabricated from three plates and 
a fabricated mounting, assembled by bolting. Incorporated in the bottom plate of 
the crosshead assembly is the mounting for the piston rod / coupling rod joint. 
This comprises a flange for the gudgeon pin and a boss into which the piston rod 
end is secured. The boss was first turned onto a mild steel blank, and was left 
overlength for subsequent adjustment when the motion was assembled. The 
crosshead blanks were then milled to profile and section, incorporating the 
bottom plate of the crosshead. Twelve bolts were prepared. The threads were 
turned from the ends of the bolts which were then drilled for split pins. In 
course of erection on PIXIE the leading two bolts of the assembly are entered 
from above the crosshead, the remainder from below. It was important that the 
assembly on Pixie replicated that employed on PIXIE, otherwise with all six 
bolts entered from the top, the projecting ends of the trailing bolts would have 
interfered with the movement of the coupling rod. Detail such as this must be 
studied carefully at the time of survey as each locomotive is likely to have 
some such idiosyncrasy. Omission of such information from the notes made at the 
time of survey could result in problems at the time of erection or worse, 
damaged parts at the time of air testing. 

The hole for the gudgeon pin was then drilled and a phosphor bronze bush 
pressed-in. To ensure a good fit the gudgeon pin is machined from silver steel, 
brought to a high finish in the lathe. As is general practice on PIXIE the ends 
of the pins are turned down and fitted with split pins for safety purposes. 

### Slippers

Slippers are of gunmetal and provide a nice exercise in milling, either in the 
milling machine or the vertical table on the lathe. As with many thin or slender 
components it is worthwhile soldering, or bonding the material to a more 
substantial section of metal. This backplate can be more readily gripped in a 
vice, or if necessary, bolted to a faceplate or bed. In this way machining can 
be carried out without fear of a nearly finished part moving under the cutting 
effort and becoming scrap. This technique was adopted for the slippers which 
were brought to within a few thousandths of the calculated finished size prior 
to filing and burnishing to fit within the crosshead, ensuring a nice easy 
action. There is a tendency to make parts too slack a fit at this stage. It must 
be bourn in mind that the running-in process affects every part of the motion 
and parts which seem quite tight at first, or trial, assembly soon free-up as 
the running in process proceeds ( using plenty of lubricant of course! ) 

### Assembling The Slide Bars, Crossheads And Motion Plate

This is a critical part of the construction. Parallelism (if there is such a 
word) between the piston centre line and the slide bar being most important for 
free running. Fortunately in the case of Pixie there was an opportunity in the 
course of the erection process to maintain this parallelity ( ? ) by adjusting 
the level of the bearing surfaces at the top of the glands and if necessary 
insertion of shim washers at the bracket on the lower edge of the motion plate. 

### Valve Gear

PIXIE is fitted with Hackworth valve gear. This gear is sometimes derided by 
pundits because vertical movement of the axles upsets the valve events to some 
extent. This has not proved to be too noticeable in the case of Pixie and indeed 
the Hackworth gear is employed effectively on what must be the hundreds of Sweet 
Pea locomotives, designed by Jack Buckler, running on club tracks about the 
country. Jack Butler contributed an excellent article to ENGINEERING IN 
MINIATURE May 1986, Volume 7, No. 12 examining some of the criticisms and 
recommending methods of optimising performance. These include adjusting the 
height of the weighshaft and ensuring the correct ride position of the axle to 
ensure that the die block pivot moves equally about the weighshaft centre. In a 
more recent edition of ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE Vol 15 No.1 June 1993 a highly 
technical article, almost of Ph.D. standard by Nigel Bennet describes the 
computer simulation of Hackworth valve gear for Edward Thomas and incorporates a 
lot of useful detail on the motion work for Sweet Pea. 

In the case of Pixie the critical dimensions of the prototype were replicated as 
accurately as possible and in the air trials these worked satisfactorily. no 
doubt the events could be fine tuned in light of Messrs Bucklers and Bennetts 
discussions, and maybe they will, when time permits perhaps. Meanwhile Pixie's 
performance is quite satisfactory with her replicated sizes incorporated. 

Hackworth gear takes its motion from the return crank fixed directly opposite 
the crank pin i.e. on a line passing through the crankpin and centre of the 
axle. The vibrating lever attached to the return crankpin connects with a pivot 
pin on the die block which runs within straight guides set upon the weighshaft. 
With the guides in line with the centre of the axle the valve rod pivot on the 
vibrating lever is driven through an oval path of which the length of the 
horizontal axis equals twice the valve lap plus the lead. Rotating the 
weighshaft alters the inclination of the guides and changes valve events 
accordingly. 

The size of the components of the valve gear was scaled down from the prototype 
and cardboard templates were employed at the drawing board to ensure that all 
would work when assembled onto Pixie. Whilst a spare weighshaft and guides was 
produced having extended slides for experimental purposes, to date these have 
not been installed. 

One end of the return crank blanks was drilled and bored to match the shouldered 
crankpin. The other end was drilled for the vibrating lever pivot pin. The blank 
was milled to shape and the pivot pin set into place using retaining fluid. The 
return crank itself was secured to the crankpin by a slotted and bolted 
connection, aided by a further touch of retaining fluid. 

The vibrating lever on PIXIE has a small marine type bearing at the lower end, 
and two bushed holes for the die block and valve rod pivot pins. As with the 
connecting and coupling rods, the marine bearing permits some small adjustment 
to be made to the geometry at the time of final erection. The vibrating lever 
blank was cut from mild steel, the pivot holes drilled and then milled to final 
shape. When milling bosses, or indeed when shaping the ends of any of the rods 
or levers by means of an an end mill in the lathe or milling machine with the 
material set upon a pin, it is important to remember that the material must only 
be moved against the direction of the cutter. Failure to observe this will 
result in the cutter attempting to ' climb ' onto the material, the resulting 
snatch causing damage to the part or, worse, the operators fingers ! Phosphor 
bronze bushes were pressed into the pivot pin holes. 

### Oil Cups And Local Lubrication

Oil cups are fitted at each pivot point and adjacent to the bearings. These oil 
cups like those on other narrow gauge locomotives add a touch of individualism, 
they are of brass, of interesting shape and can be polished, and are ' perched ' 
somewhat precariously it seems, on the vibrating levers and die blocks. Those on 
the vibrating lever were milled to shape prior to fitting the tubes which convey 
oil to the bearings. These tubes are fitted into drilled holes with just a touch 
of bonding fluid, sufficient to fix them without blocking the tubes. Each cup is 
topped with a screw plug turned from a BA bolt, the head being brought to 
profile then knurled prior to the arisses being removed. A small centre bitt was 
used to drill the countersunk breather holes in each plug. 

### Weigh Shaft, Weigh Shaft Brackets And Guides

The weigh shaft is of silver steel, shouldered to enter the back plates of the 
guide assemblies. The shaft is rotated from the reversing lever by a reach rod 
which is connected to a lug on the bottom of the right-hand guide. The cheeks of 
the guide are milled from gauge plate, later hardened by heating,and are 
attached by bolts and a locating pin passing through the backplate and the 
weighshaft. 

The weigh shaft brackets were fabricated from steel angle and plate, the lower 
section being welded-up. The top plate has small seating pieces sweated into 
place to accomodate the stud nuts when the two parts are assembled. Once the two 
parts are assembled the hole for the weigh shaft can be drilled and reamed. The 
brackets are assembled onto the frames by bolts passing through the frames and 
the frame angles. Ideally the position of the brackets should be determined when 
the whole of the motion work has been completed and the valves inserted onto the 
rods within the valve chest. At this stage the correct location can be 
established by trial and error with the brackets clamped to the frame angles. 

A modification to the guides has been suggested by Jack Buckler in describing ' 
Sweet Pea ', ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE. In his redesign the guides are milled 
from one block of mild steel, a slotted cover plate being attached by 
countersunk screws onto the front of the guides so formed. This appears to be a 
simpler form of construction and may commend itself for some models. 

### Die Blocks

Die blocks are of tee section and have a shouldered pin for connection with the 
top of the eccentric rod. this pin is entered from the back of the die block, a 
further shoulder seating in a counterbore in the back of the block. An oil cup 
is mounted on the top of the die block. With a good sliding fit achieved within 
the guides, the die block and pin were case-hardened by heating and treatment 
using ' Casenite ' 

### Reversing Lever And Sector Plate

The lever was prepared by sawing and filing from a piece of mild steel. The 
handle, with a pin for insertion into the top of the lever, was turned from a 
piece of square material and soldered into position. The latch block prepared by 
filing was soldered into position at the same heating. The latch itself was 
prepared by soldering a blade onto a square steel shaft with the top milled and 
drilled for connection to the latch lever. A small spring maintains the 
latchblade in contact with the sector plate. A good source of high quality 
springs has been found to be the plastic video tape case. On opening a defunct 
case one finds a number of small stainless steel springs also some stainless 
steel rollers as well as several self -tapping screws, all useful candidates for 
the scrap box ! 

### Slide Valves

The slide valves were machined from gunmetal, heeding LBSC's advice that 
dissimilar metals should be used for slide valves and portface. The blocks of 
gunmetal were turned to overall size in the four jaw, leaving a little on the 
length for final finishing work. then the cavity for exhaust steam was milled 
out using an plain end mill and finished with a bull-nozed bitt, care being 
taken to work within setting-out lines lightly scribed on marking blue. 

The slots for the valve rod and the recesses for the collars which are used in 
place of a buckle were milled then filed to shape, care being taken that the fit 
permitted the valve to slide freely from end to end of the valve spindle when 
set in the steam chest and before the locating bushes were installed. The face 
of the valve was rubbed on a sheet of medium wet-and- dry paper ( used dry ) to 
impart the minute scratches which, in service, retain a film of oil and assist 
in maintaining a tight joint under the steam pressure in the steam chest. it is 
of course important to ensure that the valve block is free to lift from the 
portface, it is held in contact during service by the valve chest steam pressure 
but has to be free to overcome any problems with condensate in the early stages 
of firing whilst the cylinders are cold. 

The arrangement of threaded valve rods and nuts with locknuts employed for 
fixing the valve blocks to the rods on PIXIE is replaced on Pixie by 4 bronze 
bushes ( 2 per valve block ) machined from hexagonal bronze bar. These bushes 
were initially secured to the valve rod by mild steel grub screws which whilst 
proving sound enough in service, started to rust. These have been replaced by 5 
BA set screws machined from stainless hexagonal bar. The hexagon head of the set 
screw permits greater fixing force to be applied once the correct setting has 
been achieved than was possible with the earlier grub screws. These stainless 
steel screws are secured in service using a retaining fluid. 

A general point regarding grub screws which can save problems with head breakage 
in the case of smaller sizes is that the body and most of the head of the screw 
should enter the tapped hole. In this way, when effort is applied using a 
screwdriver, the lobes at each side of the slot in the head end are supported by 
the walls of the tapped hole in the bush, wheel or whatever the screw is 
intended to secure. Where possible, when set screws or grub screws are used, the 
spindle or axle should have a small flat or dimple on which the tip of the screw 
can bear when tightened. The use of two screws in a bush permits a small drill 
to be passed down one tapped hole to form such a location whilst the bush is 
secured by the other fixing screw. 

### Dummy Slide Valves

As an aid to determining slide valve dimensions, valve setting and visualising 
the events of the slide valve assembly the modeller may care to make a pair of 
dummy slide valves. These can be simply prepared using 1 / 8 inch perspex sheet. 
The exhaust cavity position can be scribed on the base and further piece of 
perspex cemented vertically onto the ' valve '. The upright can be drilled for 
the valve rod and the valve spindle installed in the usual fashion, using grub 
screws or whatever fixing is favoured. Whatever the final arrangement for 
securing the actual valves to the spindle, for the dummy assembly two bushes 
fitted with grub screws allow trial settings. With the dummy valves set in place 
the engines can be taken through their cycle and, with the length of the valve 
scribed on the perspex, the valving checked out. This arrangement has proved 
particularly helpful in the case of Pixie where the motion was constructed to 
dimensions taken from survey and small innaccuracies arising in construction 
called for some adjustment of the valve lengths to achieve optimum performance. 
Where a model is being built to proven details this eventuality should not arise 
although it is still most interesting to see the valves in motion and to 
visualise the events. 

### Valve Spindles

The valve spindles are lengths of rustless steel, their ends terminate in bosses 
which are turned to shape, drilled and reamed for phosphor bronze bushes prior 
to being silver soldered into place. After the soldering process the bores are 
cleaned up by a pass of the reamer and a small bush pressed into place in each. 
When working on bushes of this size, the bore of the bush is often reduced by 
this squeezing action and require a pass of the reamer to bring them back to 
size. Small oil cups are mounted on the top of each bush, a fine hole being 
drilled to convey the 'amber liquid' to the bearing face. 

### Valve Rods

These are from silver steel with mild steel forks soldered at each end. The 
forks are profiled by milling and filing. Milling the rounded ends is carried 
out on a pin mounted in the small 4 jaw chuck attached to a baseplate which can 
be bolted onto the table of the milling machine. Prior to the aquisition of the 
milling machine such work was carried out using a pin mounted in a machine vice 
secured to the vertical table. In each case care has to be taken to avoid climb 
milling with resulting snatch on the part. Prior to installing the valve rods 
onto the locomotive the silver steel pins were fitted into the forks and holes 
for split pins were drilled through fork and pin. A very small drill was used, 
run at the highest speed obtainable on the drilling machine. 

Work of this nature is carried out on a sensitive drill constructed from a set 
of castings purchased from MESSRS REEVES of Birmingham. The drill formed an 
exercise in machining and boring and building the drill served to teach many a 
lesson. The result is a drill with which minute holes of considerable depth can 
be drilled with confidence, an extended arm controlling the movement of the 
quill giving a very direct ' feel ' right to that critical point where the drill 
breaks through on the underside of the material. One small amendment made to the 
design of the machine is the addition of a perspex guard around the twin pulleys 
driving the quill. One's face is often quite near to this area when 
concentrating on that last, critical hole in some assembly that represents some 
hours of work, and a broken drive belt could seriously damage a person's good 
looks ! Prior to building the sensitive drill I used an auxiliary drill chuck 
set in the lathe and used in conjunction with a drill-pad set in the tailstock, 
feed being achieved by the tailstock handwheel. This is quite an exciting 
operation, particularly with the lathe turning at top speed to suit the smaller 
number drills. Drama can result if, with the Super 7 and its self-ejecting 
mechanism, the drill-pad reaches the point of ejection before the bitt reaches 
the bottom of the hole ! 

### Valve Setting

Valve setting was carried out at the appropriate stage in the erection process. 
The best description that we have encountered in any book is that by LBSC in his 
account of building ' TICH '. As he always did, old LBSC describes the process 
in the simplest of terms, and there seems little point in repeating any but the 
key points here. these are basically that the 'crack ' of the port must occur on 
each dead centre In the case of the Hackforth valve gear, the inclination of the 
guides on the weighshaft determine the amount of the port opening. 
Unfortunately, compared with the Walschaerts' gear there is no combination lever 
to hasten the opening of the ports to exhaust, inlet and exhaust taking place at 
similar pace. This has not proved to be a problem in practice however and the 
little locomotive has ample pulling power. 

### Brake Standard

The brake standard was turned from a piece of mild steel reinforcing rod, bored 
a clearance fit for the rod. The standard is supported by two angle steel straps 
bolted into the frame supporting the footplate. On Pixie it is set-up on the 
right of the foot plate although in some previous period it has been sited on 
the left. At footplate level the standard is based upon an oval plate and 
incorporates two angle steel supports between this plate and the standard 
proper. At the top a bracket takes support from the frame of the rear 
weatherboard. Near the top of the rod and within an enlarged section of the 
standard is a collar which, being pinned to the shaft, acts as a bearing 
resisting the thrust as braking effort is applied by rotating the brake handle 
clockwise. As the force set up by putting the brake off is relatively small, a 
keeper plate, retained by small round head screws tapped into the top face of 
the standard, is sufficiently substantial to provide a bearing surface. this is 
one of the few places in railway mechanical engineering that such screws are 
encountered. 

The rod passes through the footplate into a substantial bush set in the fork of 
the actuating lever. the thread on PIXIE is of course a buttressed thread, that 
on Pixie, a ' common or garden ' Whitworth thread... we did say that Pixie was a 
near-scale model ! The brakeshaft sits in two bushes bolted to the frames. 
Actuating rods form a connection between cranks on the brakeshaft and transverse 
rods passing through clearance holes in the bottom of the brake hangers. The 
actuating rods are maintained in the correct transverse position by bushes and 
split pins, some allowance for adjustment to the brake set-up is provided by a 
series of holes in the back end of the actuating rods.

blast and petticoat pipes. Blower ring.*

![SmokeboxDoor]
> Smokebox door, coupling block and location of axle driven pump

### Smokebox

The smokebox was turned from a piece of steam barrel, not on first sight a 
prepossessing piece of material. Turning in the four jaw revealed an immaculate 
piece of high quality steel however and this was soon brought to the correct 
diameter and length. Before removal from the lathe, lines were scribed 
longitudinally onto marking fluid on the outer surface at 90 degrees intervals 
as a guide for use later in setting out the position of the chimney, the 
openings for the steam and exhaust pipes, and importantly the holes for the 
bolts which are used to connect the smokebox to the saddle. This marking was 
aided by using the simple dividing attachment described later in the book, the 
lines being scribed using a point tool in the topslide tool holder and 
traversing the saddle. 

The position of the hole for the chimney was next established and marked out, 
again using marking fluid. The tube was then set on end and clamped to the 
saddle with packing such that the centre of the hole was on the axis of the 
lathe. The hole was started using a centre bitt, followed by a succession of 
drill bits up to the largest available, finally being brought to size using a 
boring tool mounted in the four-jaw chuck. 

Two pieces of ply were bandsawn to the profile of the outer diameter of the 
smokebox tube. Spaced by a block of wood these permitted the location of the 
tube, on its side, on the table of the drilling machine. Where just a few 
operations are to be carried out, such an arrangement, whilst quickly produced 
is adequate in providing a sound support. If there were a number of similar 
operations something more substantial would be employed. Apertures for the steam 
and exhaust pipes were then set out. These openings were formed by chain 
drilling and some careful work with ' junior ' hacksaws. The ends of the saws 
being wrapped with insulating tape to avoid damage to the inside of the smokebox 
tube. Two saws were used, one the common ' junior ' saw with the blade parallel 
to the handle, the other with the frame cranked through 90 degrees enabling the 
cuts around the perimeter of the tube to be made. The edges of the openings were 
finished by filing. Holes for the bolts securing the smokebox to the saddle were 
then set out and drilled, still using the ply cradle to support the tube, these 
would be subsequently transferred to the top of the saddle casting. 

### Smokebox Door

A disk of 'mild steel' yielded the smokebox door, after a fight that was ! The 
blank proved to be extremely hard, possibly as a result of some long-past 
cropping operation. This is a problem sometimes encountered when ones material 
comes from scrapboxes, breakers yards and similar sources, although a problem 
which will not be encountered by modelmakers who patronise the trade supplying ' 
bona fide ' model engineering materials ! The result was that having taken the 
edge off, and the temper out of, several tools it became necessary to set up 
green-grit grinding wheel in a power drill and having protected the lathe bed 
with rags, applying this to the blank as it rotated in the lathe. Unorthodox as 
this may have been, it did the trick. Fortunately there was no hard spot in the 
centre of the piece, and after drilling the blank was mounted on a bolt whilst 
the inner face was relieved to leave just a small ' land ' which would ensure a 
good seal on the front smokebox ring. What LBSC would have described as a ' 
nobby ' handle, and what the writer sees as a Victorian cupboard door handle is 
screwed into the central hole to complete the door. Other prototypes employ 
darts and crossbars with perhaps keys and locking handles, these provide some 
exercise in watchmaking. Crossbars to retain the dart are seated into brackets 
rivetted to the front smokebox ring. These are not needed on Pixie as the door 
is retained by two angle steel brackets and ball handles 

### Smokebox Rings

On PIXIE, as on a number of narrow gauge locomotives, the smokebox front is a 
piece of plate mounted on the firebox by a rolled steel angle. this arrangement 
is represented on Pixie by using a one-piece gunmetal casting turned to profile. 
Dummy bolts in the front face represent those connecting the plate and ring of 
the prototype. Such an arrangement often proves simpler in model form than would 
fabrication using separate components, in this case it makes the sealing of the 
firebox easier to achieve. 

A plaster pattern had been prepared for the smokebox ring castings. The pattern 
was ' horsed ' as described earlier and yielded the two castings which, whilst 
crude, contained the necessary material. The rings were prepared by first 
machining the external form with the casting set-up on the reversed jaws of the 
four jaw chuck. The outer face of the front ring was turned to a snug fit within 
the smokebox tube, leaving the small projection which simulated the thickness of 
the front plate where it laps over the front edge of the tube. Set-ups of this 
type must be approached with care as thermal expansions tend to loosen the grip 
of the chuck. Frequent checking is essential. With the outer edges machined, the 
face and inner section of the casting could be brought to profile. This was 
carried out with the ring gripped within the jaws of the chuck, here again care 
is required to avoid distorting the now quite slender ring whilst tightening the 
chuck. The back ring was turned to a neat fit within the tube then set aside 
until the inside diameter could be ascertained from the boiler. 

The front ring was next drilled for the bolts which on the prototype connect the 
front plate and the annular angle. The twenty bolts are installed nut outside, 
one shares the duty of supporting the lamp iron at the top in front of the 
chimney. 

### Hinge Plate, Lugs, Pins And Catches

Mild steel plate was used for the hinge plate. In order that the back face could 
be turned to match the form of the door the blank was cut to rough outline and 
set up on a faceplate. A secure fixing was obtained by using bolts screwed into 
tapped holes in parts of the hinge plate which would later be machined away. 
With a good fit obtained between the hinge plate and the outer face of the door, 
the blank was filed to profile. 

To ensure the airtight joint essential to good draughting under steam, care must 
be taken with the geometry of the hinge points. A few minutes work with pencil 
and card will reveal that the hinge point must be so placed that the door opens 
both outwards and away from the front ring of the smokebox. It may be necessary 
to slightly relieve the edge of the door adjacent to the hinge to ensure 
clearance. Once the geometry has been resolved the hinge plate can be milled or 
filed to final profile and rivetted onto the door. The hinge lugs are filed up 
to shape from square mild steel, set into the four jaw and turned to accept a 
thread. A bright steel hinge pin is lightly tapered at one end and fitted with a 
collar. The lugs can be slipped onto the pin which is passed through the hinge 
plate and the whole offered-up to the front ring. It may prove necessary at this 
stage to make some small adjustment to the shoulders on the lugs to bring the 
perimeter of the door into contact with the front plate to ensure the essential 
airtight joint when the door is closed. 

Twin steel angle brackets secure Pixie's door in the closed position. These are 
mounted on studs set into the smokebox front ring and are tightened by two ' 
ball headed nuts ', which present a nice piece of ornamental turning. This is an 
example where a note on the survey sketch would have resulted in a more 
authentic model, these ball handles appear on later inspection to be of gunmetal 
and not mild steel as reproduced ! The manufacture of these handles was however 
most a enjoyable exercise. The profiles were generated offhand, using a bar 
clamped under the MYFORD tool clamp as a tool support. After parting off the 
blanks with a ball at each end were set into the drilling machine vice, 
sandwiched between two scaps of steel having countersunk holes to provide a 
locating grip for the blanks. With the blanks set to the correct angle the 
larger ball was then drilled ad tappped for the stud which is set into the front 
face of the smokebox. 

### Wet Header

The wet header was turned from a piece of gunmetal rod, it sits in a bush 
soldered into the smokebox tubeplate. Three stainless steel bolts pass through 
the header into holes tapped into the boiler bush. The steam pipe ( from the 
regulator ) enters the header and the joint is sealed by an ' O ' ring. A small 
diameter pipe from the lubricator delivers oil into the steam at this point. 
Whilst generally this is done by inserting tees into the steam pipes nearer the 
cylinders or by means of displacement lubricators mounted on the steam chest 
covers, the current arrangement appears to be satisfactory and does not lead to 
priming as the steam ports of the Stroudley type regulator are set high in the 
steam dome and thus considerably above the level of the outlet at the header. 

### Steam, Blast And Petticoat Pipes

After careful annealing, the steam pipes were bent to shape and fitted with the 
flanges to connect with the cylinder casting. The flanges were silver soldered 
to the pipes and care was required to ensure the correct orientation of these 
flanges to suit the location of the fixing studs in the cylinder block. The 
upper ends were then soldered into the wet header during the same heating as the 
lubricator pipe. 

Exhaust steam pipes were formed from 1 / 2 inch diameter copper pipe which had 
to be annealed frequently in the course of producing the reverse bends between 
the cylinder block and the connection for the blower ring. A jig was prepared 
replicating the actual position of the holes in the cylinder casting for the 
blast pipes and the proposed location of the blower ring, determined by the type 
of ring selected. The connection between the twin exhaust pipes was filed up 
from two pieces of mild steel, the two halves were clamped together and the 
holes for connecting bolts drilled. The assembled joint was then drilled and 
tapped for the installation of the combined blast pipe and blower nozzle and a 
small slug of metal prepared to fair-in the joint and improve the flow of steam 
once the joint is assembled. The parts were all assembled into the jig and the 
flange and connecting block joints were all soldered at one heating. In the case 
of all flanged connections the flanges are prepared as a pair and then used to 
spot the holes for the fixing bolts. a centre popped mark ensures that the 
flanges are used where intended and thus minor discrepancies in hole centres are 
overcome. 

### Blower Ring

As the ring on PIXIE is a loop of small diameter tubing and replication in model 
form would not perhaps have provided a satisfactory draught, a rather more 
sophisticated type of blast ring was incorporated. This took the form of of a 
combined blast nozzle and blower with an annular chamber around the nozzle 
pierced by very small holes to provide the blower jets. The arrangement has been 
detailed in several articles in the technical press over the years. 

### Petticoat Pipe

A piece of copper pipe from a recent domestic plumbing job was annealed ready 
for spinning. The pipe was plugged at one end to avoid distortion in the three 
jaw, the other end was then spun-up to a push fit in the chimney base using a 
polished piece of silver steel supported from a piece of stock bar clamped into 
the tool holder. The first plug was removed and the newly expanded end was 
plugged then spun. Frequent annealing permitted the eventual achievement of the 
required form. On erection the petticoat pipe would be fixed using a smear of 
instant gasket.

*Boilers. Home built vs. proprietary supply. Construction techniques. Location. 
Cleading.*

![Boiler]
> A boiler from a proprietary supplier, this one for the Allchin

### Boilers - Home Build Vs Proprietary Supply

Tackled systematically and following upon the advice of the masters such as 
L.B.S.C, Alec Farmer Martin Evans and Keith Wilson the task of boiler 
construction is within the capability of most model engineers. Where possible 
the modelmaker will be wise to enlist the assistance of an experienced person in 
constructing his first boiler, in the case of the writer this person was a dear 
old gentleman who had for many years been employed in all types of plate 
fabrication and jointing using welding, brazing and soldering and many different 
techniques for a range of materials. The following comment arises from 
experience in building that first boiler, the advice recieved from the 
aforementioned old gentleman who provided me with the basics of soldering 
practice. Other people have joined evening classes or attended short courses 
held during the vacation at various Universities and colleges. Usually these 
events are organised and staffed by experienced technicians prepared to guide 
participants through the tricky parts of the operation. They also provide access 
to that most important ingredient of good boilermaking, the substantial heat 
source. 

The keys to successful boiler building are; a proven design, care in obtaining 
good fits between parts, absolute cleanliness, and an adequate heat source. 
Given these essentials together with space and time the beginner can produce 
what L.B.S.C described as the ' kettle ' for their locomotive. In the case of 
Pixie, experience gained in producing the boiler for an earlier 3 1/2" gauge 
locomotive had convinced the writer of the difficulty of providing sufficient 
heat using existing equipment, both propane and butane torches. To avoid 
problems, and economise on time available for model engineering work, the 
decision was made to sublet the boiler construction. 

This proved to be a wise decision and should there be any doubt in the modellers 
mind as to whether he can afford the equipment or obtain the necessary support 
and assistance, he would do well to consider obtaining a ready-made boiler from 
one of the many experts advertising in the trade journals. In this case it may 
only be necessary to phone several suppliers to obtain a quotation for a boiler 
for a specific model to a published design. Various well known specialist 
suppliers spring to mind and one cannot go far wrong in purchasing from any of 
these. Although there are a few widely known suppliers, prior knowledge passed 
on by a fellow club member may direct ones choice to another fabricator who 
although perhaps not so widely known has proved his ability in a previous 
supply. 

Non-standard boilers such as that required for Pixie call for a slightly 
different approach. Here, whilst the overall dimensions are known, the design of 
the boiler and its staying is best left to a builder with with a proven track 
record. After obtaining several ' budget ' figures it was decided to employ a 
boilermaker with an excellent record, although the budget price quoted was not 
the lowest. The fact that the builder had for many years manufactured a range of 
standard boilers, so much so that his firm had a ' household name ', generated 
confidence. As well as being approachable the proprietor was exceedingly 
knowledgeable and was most helpful in assisting with design input. 

Armed with outline details, especially critical dimensions of items such as the 
location of the tank support brackets, firehole door, steam fountain and dome, 
arrangements were made for a meeting at the firms stand at the MODEL ENGINEERING 
EXHIBITION. Here the boilermaker advised upon such matters as the number and 
location of tubes, size and bore of bushes, desirability or otherwise, in fact 
otherwise, of superheater and so on. After the meeting these details were 
transferred to a finished drawing on which the final quotation was to be based. 
At this stage the builder knew exactly what was expected of him and as a result 
could provide an accurate quotation of what the cost would be, an essential to a 
satisfactory business deal. Here it should be bourn in mind that money that we 
spend on a boiler today would, a few years ago, have purchased quite a 
reasonable motor car ! Boilers from commercial suppliers come with a boiler test 
certificate which must not be confused with the certificate required by clubs 
where the locomotive is to be run. The certificate simply indicates the pressure 
contained during a raw test, probably before the bushes were drilled out to 
tapping size. Although the criteria vary from club to club, officials will 
require more stringent testing, including the efficiency of the safety valves, 
before they issue a club certificate. 

In the event that the model engineer decides to go it alone, it makes sense, in 
the case of a standard model for which designs have been published, to make use 
of the ready flanged plate service offered by many suppliers. This will save a 
lot of time and, whilst costing more than obtaining the raw material and 
flanging up over hardwood or mild steel formers, can prove more economic in 
time, and material. The price of flanged plates can be maintained at an economic 
level because as well as re-using the formers many times in the course of 
production, the proprietary supplier has a better chance of planning his 
material usage in the course of a production run. He can work far more 
economically than does the individual attempting to cut a set of plates from his 
one piece of sheet copper. 

### Construction Techniques

A first class boiler, and we must not settle for anything less, demands 
excellent materials. These will be found in the catalogues of the proprietary 
suppliers to the hobby. With the materials to hand, the plates must be set out 
in the most economic fashion. Here paper templates are essential, these can be 
shuffled around on the raw material to provide a best fit and thus the utmost 
economy in material. The lines are best transferred to the material using a 
waterproof overhead projector pen. In this way scribing is avoided at this stage 
and the lines can be simply erased using a rag soaked in methylated spirits. 
Where essential the lines can be lightly scribed once the best layout has been 
achieved. 

To cut the plating material obtain the largest pair of snips possible, grip one 
handle in the vice and slip a piece of pipe of suitable diameter over the other. 
With this arrangement, not only can considerable force be applied when 
necessary, but also very small cuts can be made slowly with great precision. 

Whilst the platework can be prepared using the range of hand tools owned by most 
model engineers there are one or two additional tools which can make platework 
easier. a planishing hammer, a cross faced hammer and a large pair of tongs, 
mine are in fact medical forceps as used in delivering babies ! Plumbers gland 
or automotive pump pliers are useful for grasping hot metal. Also overlever 
wrenches such as the ' MOLE ' wrench make useful quick release clamps. 

When flanging, anneal plate frequently by heating to a medium red then plunging 
it into cold water. The tendency to take a plate ' just a little bit further ' 
before annealing must be avoided as cracks will result due to work hardening of 
the metal. When preparing the tube holes in the tubeplates, countersink the 
holes, roughen the edges of the holes and file small nicks in the periphery of 
the hole to promote the flow of solder into the joint and around the tube. 

Where it is necessary to drill copper plate for tubes, bushes and the like, Alec 
F. Farmer suggests a useful dodge which will be appreciated anyone having 
experienced the snatch of a drill as it breaks through the material. He 
recommends that drill bitts for copper plate should be ground in such a way that 
the tips cut the plate almost in the manner of a trepanning cut and so that the 
lips of the drill remove a curl of swarf from within this cut. The point of the 
drill seats within a pilot hole drilled after the centre of the hole has been 
set-out an positively spotted using a centre punch. 

### Assembling The Boiler Parts

On the matter of soldering one can do no better than to read ( and view in the 
series of more than 300 photographs ) the advice of Alec F. Farmer. Not the 
least of the tips passed on in this treatise, 'Model Locomotive Boiler Making' 
is the mixture that Alec uses when making up flux. He uses 2 heaped 
TABLESPOONFULS of flux powder, a 1 / 4 TEASPOONFUL of household detergent and 
mixes these to a creamy consistency with water. Using this mixture we are told 
that the detergent breaks down the surface tension of the liquid, ensuring 
penetration into the joint as well as degreasing the components being soldered, 
the greases being replaced by flux and then burnt off. As well as adding the 
detergent to the flux paste, cleaning and degreasing of components, prior to 
painting on the flux, has been found to provide the best results. With the joint 
painted with flux and the metal quickly brought to red heat. the flux will be 
seen to glaze and melt. The solder stick or wire, applied with the metal at this 
temperature, will melt and flash into joints. If blobs appear these have to be 
dispersed using a scratch, a wire ground to a point and bent through a right 
angle at the end. The solder will flow to the hottest parts of the joint and can 
be drawn along by judicious heating. Once a bright line of solder is apparent 
along or around the joint the parts can be allowed to cool before immersion in 
pickle. Final cleaning of soldered joints is best carried out using steel wool 
or scouring powder, after 1 / 2 an hour or so in pickle. 

Firebricks as a wall around the hearth which is banked up with crushed firebrick 
maintain all available heat in the soldering process around the parts being 
worked on. A useful source of firebrick is the redundant storage heater. If it 
should be necessary to purchase bricks then a local laboratory supply company 
will generally stock the genuine article. 

It is advisable to have a trial assembly of as much of the boiler as possible ' 
dry '. Holes can then be drilled, in key positions, for small rivets to hold the 
parts firmly during the soldering operations that follow. The pundits have 
always advised the use of differing grades of solder for the ongoing soldering 
operations to avoid spoiling joints made earlier. Due to the way in which the 
solder amalgamates with the copper in the course of the soldering process whilst 
advisable this is however, not essential. 

### Firehole Door

Arrangements had been made at the time of ordering Pixie's boiler for the 
provision of blind bushes for later attachment of the firehole door hinge plate 
( Care being taken to ensure that these were set on the correct side of the 
firehole ring ), also a bush for the spur. The firehole door with its hinge 
incorporating two shaped gusset pieces was set in place and clamped in the 
closed position against the firehole ring. With the hinge plate, again 
fabricated from mild steel located within the projecting gussets the hinge pin 
position could be marked and the hole for the pin drilled in the door gussets. 
At that stage the fixing bush positions were transferred to the hinge plate, the 
plate drilled and the hole positions spotted through to the bushes which were in 
their turn drilled and tapped. The spur for the latch, profiled from a piece of 
mild steel, was set into the four jaw for the end to be turned and threaded for 
insertion into the bush on the boiler. At this stage the latch lever could be 
cut to shape and brought to thickness, ensuring a good fit in the spur with the 
door closed tightly. A baffle was then cut to size which allowed it to pass 
through the firehole ring without binding when mounted, using a small parallel 
collar to space it from the door proper. On Pixie a small length of chain is 
used to lift the latch. In practice it is more likely lifted by the fireman's 
shovel, however the chain is provided and as on the prototype it terminates in a 
ring through the small shelf above the firehole door 

### Cleading

There has been considerable discussion in the model press regarding the 
insulation values of available materials. For Pixie the asbestos replacement 
material supplied by the trade has proved successful. The material was easy to 
cut to pattern, did not stretch or distort in the course of handling and 
installation and was sufficiently rigid to remain firmly in place until the 
cleading material was fitted and the boiler bands set in place. In shaping the 
material the use of patterns is essential, it takes but a few minutes with paper 
and scissors to produce quite accurate patterns, indeed the lady of the house 
may well find that this is an area where she can make a contribution ! The 
material is best cut on a sheet of hardboard using a sharp knife or a scalpel. 
Prior to installing the cleading the insulation can be held in place around the 
boiler using soft iron wire or even the plastic coated wire sold for use in the 
garden. These wires serve as an extra pair of hands and can be snipped away 
after the cleading is in place. 

A further set of patterns are required for the cleading plates. It is important 
when cutting the plate material to remember to allow for the overlap at the 
joint. The time honoured method of using snips, with one of the handles secured 
in the vice and a piece of pipe on the other, makes short work of the straight 
cuts. A nibbler is fine for this job although it may be worthwhile protecting 
the metal from scoring by laying sellotape along the line of the cut. For curves 
and for the formation of the large diameter holes for boiler fittings, chain 
drilling and a sharp chisel will suffice or, rather more laboriously, a metal 
cutting blade in the saw frame. Precautions are required to avoid scoring or 
burring the metal and particularly, forming creases which will prove impossible 
to remove. 

In the case of Pixie a supply of half-hard brass was available, this was used 
although the pundits advise using thin mild steel Although the material is a 
kindly one in use and tin snips can be used for cutting it to shape, care has to 
be taken in installation to avoid a local sharp bend which can produce an 
irremovable crease in the plate. Attempts to remove such a crease will only 
emphasize it so it is best left alone, that is if the builder can live with it, 
otherwise that piece should be set aside for a less visible use and a new plate 
prepared. In the absence of bending rolls, and few of us are fortunate enough to 
possess these, a variety of formers can be used to roll the plate, clean 
scaffold tube, preferably the lightweight variety, even a jam jar has been 
pressed ( with care ) into service, work being carried out on a piece of carpet 
to preserve the face of the material. 

The boiler bands are fairly straightforward provided that the correct length is 
first established using a piece of wire wrapped around the cleading which is 
temporarily held in place by wires, as was the insulation. Small sections of 
angle steel, drilled for the fixing bolts are rivetted and soldered to the ends 
of the boiler bands, remembering to leave a tongue of the band projecting beyond 
one of the angles to maintain the line of the banding. With the bands assembled, 
the wires temporarily retaining the cleading plating can be snipped allowing the 
bands to do the job for which they are designed.

spindles and wheels. Pumps. Gauges. Sanding gear. Clacks and dummy injectors.*

### Plumbing

One of the attractions of locomotives large or small is the profusion of 
pipework, both in copper and brass. Much of this is visible and can be polished, 
adding to the aura of a model. When preparing runs of pipe, once their routing 
has been established it is advisable to replicate the pipe using a length, or 
lengths, of fairly stiff wire. Straightened out, the wire(s) will give an 
accurate length measurement which would otherwise be difficult to achieve. Many 
of the pipes on PIXIE have a joiner in mid-run, this is helpful when it comes to 
erection when the two lengths of a pipe can be installed, sometimes a fiddley 
job, the joiner inserted and the pipes coupled up. 

L.B.S.C. had a lot to say about pipes and unions and there can be little doubt 
that he was right to ridicule the overlarge unions seen on many standard gauge 
models on 3 1/2 inch gauge track. His solution was to solder the cone directly 
onto the pipe thus avoiding union linings which have of necessity to be of such 
a diameter that the pipe can be entered into them. Size is not such a problem in 
2 1/2 inch scale and on Pixie linings incorporating the cone are soldered onto 
the pipe ends. This soldering is best carried out by applying the heat to the 
inside of the lining whilst touching the fluxed outside of the pipe and lining 
with 1/16" diameter rod of silver solder. 

### Gland Nuts And Union Nuts

Gland nuts for valves will be of standard sizes and a number should be 
fabricated for stock. A small recess cut with a minute boring tool will form the 
locating groove for an 'O' ring seal adjacent to the butress end of the nut, 
steam or water tightness can be achieved with just the slightest turn of the nut 
on the Model Engineer thread. 

Gland and union nuts are made from appropriately sized hexagonal brass bar. The 
bar is first centered from the tailstock then drilled using the appropriate bitt 
for the thread employed. Model Engineer threads are used universally for 
fittings and a glance at any catalogue will indicate the appropriate size of 
threads for specific pipe sizes. It is worthwhile making up a ' D ' bitt to 
complete this stage of the work and provide a square face to the buttress. Next 
drill a few thousandths of an inch larger than the diameter of the pipe is taken 
just beyond the overall length of the nut. Tapping is carried out with the tap 
supported by the tailstock centre, finishing with a plug tap. A touch with a a 
chamfer tool or a smooth file ( with a good handle ) applies the chamfers and 
the piece is completed by parting-off. 

### Union Liners

Making liners is an enjoyable job, especially where a four tool turret is 
available ( and if it isn' t, now is a good time to make one! ) The angle 
setting of the chamfer tool forming the cone on the liner can be set from a 
centre-bitt mounted in the tailstock drill chuck and once set can remain in 
position until a batch of work is complete. A knife tool is set into another 
position in the holder. With a parting tool set in the rear tool post production 
can commence. A length of brass bar of diameter which will just enter the thread 
to be cut in the union nut is set in the 3 jaw, centred and drilled from the 
tailstock chuck, using firstly a centre-bitt then a drill of the diameter of the 
pipe bore. The hole is taken rather deeper than the turned and shouldered length 
of the lining plus the length of the cone. This is to ensure a through hole 
after parting-off. Next a drill of the a few thousandths of an inch greater than 
the outside diameter of the pipe is taken down to the line of the eventual 
shoulder, this provides a positive stop for the pipe end. The parallel portion 
of the liner is now turned to a diameter a fraction under that of the hole in 
the buttress face of the union nut. The chamfer tool is plunged in leaving a 
short length of the original diameter between the cone and the shoulder. The 
parting off tool completes the job, bringing the cone to length. If the dial 
readings are noted as the first component is made then manufacture of a batch of 
linings becomes almost automatic. 

### Union Olives

Small cones or olives can be used where it is required to reduce the overall 
size of a union or connector. From the range of copper tube available it is 
usually possible to select one that is a sliding fit on the size of pipe to be 
connected or secured. To obtain the correct cone angle a chamfer tool can be set 
to a centre bit in the headstock drill chuck. Several cones can be produced in 
quick succession from the copper tube held in the three jaw chuck. A sharp tool 
and high speed will be required to avoid distorting the tube, particularly when 
parting off which should be done leaving a small shoulder. These cones soldered 
into place on the tube, using the merest touch of solder require very little 
force on the union nut to achieve a tight joint. 

### Valve Bodies

Manufacture of valves is quite a time consuming operation and some builders may 
wish to buy theirs from the trade. It is always difficult to get exactly what is 
required for a specific prototype however and the following should prove helpful 
to those who wish, or are forced, to have a go for themselves. Trade suppliers 
market useful material for the body of valves in the form of tees and double-tee 
castings. These save the constructor the trouble of building-up bodies from bar 
or rod. 

At this stage a set of tapped bushes will prove to be most useful. Produced in 
the three jaw, drilled, tapped and marked for number one jaw in a series of 
Model Engineer thread sizes, these bushes permit bodies to be mounted securely 
for turning and drilling operations without thread damage. The set of bushes, 
which should include 3/16, 1/4 and 5/16 sizes as a minimum, can be set 
aside and re-used, so that time spent in their manufacture will be amply repaid 
as work proceeds on further models . The valve body casting can mounted in the 
four jaw, the first end to be threaded centered and lined with the axis of the 
lathe. This can be achieved by centre punching the approximate centre of the 
spigot, lodging this on a centre set in the tailstock and then lining-up the 
body by adjusting the chuck jaws, the tailstock can then be withdrawn. With the 
body thus set the outside diameter of the body can be machined as far as the 
intersection of the limbs of the valve. The limb can be brought to length, 
centre drilled and a hole drilled a slight clearance over the pipe size. A 
suitable size of centre bit can then be used to form an internal chamfer to suit 
the liner. The external thread for the gland nut can now be cut, ideally using a 
tailstock die holder. In the absence of a tailstock die holder the nose of a 
tailstock drill chuck can be brought along to bear on the back of a standard 
diestock to maintain the correct line of thread. With the body still mounted in 
the mandrel the hole for the valve spindle can be drilled to the required depth 
and the body tapped to suit the spindle. Once one limb of a casting has been 
threaded externally it is a simple matter to mount it in one of the previously 
prepared mandrels, set in the three jaw chuck for further turning and completion 
of the other limb(s) ready for union nuts. With all limbs completed it becomes 
matter of a few minutes work with a succession of files to complete the body 
profile. For this operation the valve body, still in the mandrel can be 
transferred to a vice or the chuck set on the mounting plate described in the 
chapter on simple tools and attachments. 

### Valve Spindles

These are generally made from rustless steel and are best made several at a 
time. A length of material set in the three jaw and fine turned to the 
appropriate spigot diameter. this may if required be coned using a smooth, flat 
file. Threading is carried out using the tailstock die holder or a diestock 
supported from a tailstock drill chuck. The neck of the spindle can then be 
turned to diameter and, if required, the end filed square for attachment of the 
valve wheel. An accurate square section can be achieved using the simple 
indexing attachment described later. After parting off, if the valve wheel is to 
be fitted permanently, the gland nut should assembled onto the spindle before 
the end is swaged or punched. Where the wheel is to be threaded onto the spindle 
sufficient length of thread should be allowed to enable a lock-nut to be fitted. 

It is important to ensure that valve spindles remain captive in the body of the 
valve whilst in their open position. Spindles which unscrew completely from the 
body of the valve are potentially hazardous in service. Spindles can be rendered 
captive by reducing the spindle diameter where it passes through the gland nut 
such that a shoulder is formed beneath the ' land ' of the nut. When the valve 
spindle is unscrewed this shoulder bears against the buttress so formed, 
preventing its complete withdrawal. 

### Valve Wheels

Those who manufacture their own valves will be faced with the production of 
valve wheels that convey the spirit of the prototype. There have been several 
methods suggested in the model press and the following are though to provide 
convincing wheels. A.G Neville in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 146, No 3644 described a 
method using six lengths of thick walled tube, silver soldered around the 
circumference of a central tube. These were held in place for the soldering 
operation by soft iron wire. Succeeding operations were to part off suitable 
lengths for individual wheels, lightly countersink the holes and file the rim to 
required final section. 

LBSC describes a method of building ' cool ' wheels where a coiled wire is 
soldered around the periphery of a turned brass wheel centre. Requiring 
considerable care in production this does produce a good looking and effective 
wheel. 

A person coming new to model engineering will do well to buy a few nuts and 
cones, or even a complete valve to serve as patterns for their plumbing work. 
From these the general proportions can be gauged rather more easily than from 
the many drawings that are published in the model press. Of course the fanatic 
can produce fully scaled models of fittings if they wish, but most of us are 
happy with conventional model fittings. as has been said before, we set our own 
standards to suit our purses and the time available. 

### Pumps

The use of ' O ' rings for packing pistons and glands ensures that the very 
beginner can manufacture efficient pumps. In the days of graphited yarn and 
tallowed hemp, the amount of packing and the tightness of gland nuts was 
critical, too little and pressure was lost, too much and excessive friction 
resulted. With careful machining, in accordance with the manufacturers 
instructions, pistons and glands will be perfectly tight with the least possible 
amount of friction developing. In the case of piston packings some small pieces 
of tool steel ground to the correct width for the main sizes of ' O ' ring will 
save time in preparing the necessary grooves. For gland nuts, small diameter 
boring tools, again ground up to the correct profile can be set into the tool 
holder described later to machine the internal grooves in glands. 

Pumps should be located such that the eccentric rod is as long as possible. This 
reduces the wear on glands as well as cutting out a certain amount of the 
friction in the system. The length of the ram is also critical in this respect.. 
In Pixie the pump is mounted behind the front beam, below the saddle, on a block 
profiled such that the axis of the pump lines with the centre of the front axle. 
This position was chosen as the available space was limited by the position of 
the main stretcher spanning between the motion plates. There would also have 
been insufficient clearance around the back axle for the sweep of the eccentric 
strap. The mounting block is secured to the front beam by countersunk screws 
hidden behind the front coupling, the pump in its turn being bolted to the 
block. This arrangement will permit the pump to be dropped down from between the 
frames in the event of maintenance being required. 

Pump rams are best made of rustless steel, barrels are generally gunmetal 
castings incorporating the stand and valve box and are readily obtainable from 
the trade. Rustless steel balls, a suitable sized ' O ' ring and some hexagon 
brass bar complete the material requirements. Construction details have been 
spelled out many times in the model engineering press and there is little point 
in repeating them here. LBSC gave good coverage in his collection entitled ' 
LBSC's Shop Shed and Road ' which describes several types of pump and their 
construction. He notes the key points, for efficiency of eccentric driven pumps 
as being, ' fairly large bore and short stroke, ample sized ball valves with 
restricted lift, minimum clearance within the pump itself, and the water pipes ( 
especially the suction ) of sufficient diameter not to throttle the flow of 
water '. 

A crosshead driven pump has a lot to offer, not the least being accessibility 
for adjustment and maintenance. Discussing the the advantages of a 
crosshead-driven feedwater pump in the case of ' Rob Roy ', Martin Evans rightly 
states that ' such a pump is readily accessible for servicing, if the pump 
doesn't function for some reason such as balls sticking or becoming furred-up, 
it is only the work of minutes to take the whole thing off, strip it right down 
and clean the valves etc.' 

### Gauges

There have been some magical articles in the model press, written by wizards who 
have made their own gauges complete with microscopic Bourdon tubes. The beginner 
will do well to buy-in his gauges from a specialist supplier. Gauges are not the 
thing to cut ones teeth on, particularly when dealing with the substantial 
pressures that our locomotives are capable of producing. Those who have an 
overwhelming desire to construct their own gauges should study the article in 
Model Engineer. This will probably prove sufficient to prompt them to start out 
for the nearest trade supplier of the finished article! The gauges on Pixie were 
purchased from a suppliers catalogue, one for the boiler pressure, taking its 
feed from the steam fountain, the other measuring valve chest pressure. The 
latter is fed from the right hand valve chest via a ' tee ' incorporating a 
drain valve complete with a tap reminiscent of that to be found on a antique 
Samovar, complete with ebony handle, replicated here by a turned, stained and 
varnished piece of hardwood on a mild steel spindle. 

### Sanding Gear

Sandboxes are a prominent feature on most narrow gauge locomotives, being 
especially necessary in the conditions in which narrow gauge locomotives 
operate. Making the sandboxes on any narrow gauge locomotive should give the 
builder great deal of enjoyment. Whether mounted on the running plates, on top 
the boiler or as in the case of the Wrenn Class on the front of the saddle tank, 
they probably include a degree of geometry. The many patterns can be produced by 
turning or using a combination of turned parts and barrel or formed sheet. 
Sandboxes are another of the features which generate atmosphere and care was 
taken to replicate those on the model. For Pixie the mild steel fronts and backs 
of the boxes were flanged up over a piece of 1/4 inch plate which was cut to the 
correct profile, with allowance for the plate thickness to be used, and rounded 
on one edge. As the flange was to be relatively narrow flanging could be done 
cold without too much upset to the metal. With the profiled plate sandwiched 
between the template and a slightly smaller piece of stock steel it was 
gradually flanged using hammer with a smooth face. Progressing around the plate 
about 1/8 inch of flange was formed without creases. After removal from the 
templates the flanges were brought to uniform thickness by filing, paired off 
and marked in two sets. With the plates set flange to flange, the outside edges 
were trued locally, again by filing. 

A wire was bent around the perimeter of the flange to establish the length of 
the strips of mild steel infill which were to form the sides, top and bottom of 
the boxes. The strips were then bent to the required profile and small 
adjustments made to ensure a neat butt joint. At this stage a small hole was 
drilled centrally where the flange for the cover would be located. This was 
thought necessary to avoid any possibility of an explosion as each box was 
sealed during welding! Now the three pieces of each box were wired together and 
the welding operation carried out. Welding was only adopted for this assembly as 
access was available to TIG welding equipment, brazing would have been equally 
acceptable. After the assemblies had been cleaned-up the filler openings were 
drilled and bored and flanges for the covers were soldered into place. 

With the boxes clamped to the topslide of the lathe the holes for bushes for the 
operating rod could be drilled. As the rod passes through four bushes, two in 
each box, the lathe set-up was used in order to ensure that the holes lined 
correctly, parallel to the faces of the boxes. The bushes for the operating rod 
were then soldered into place, location aided by turned shoulders, bearing 
against the sandbox sides and the insertion of a length of rod which had been 
thoroughly oxidised to prevent it becoming a permanent installation! Now the 
back of each box was drilled for the fixing bolts which were to engage in the 
blind, stepped bushes in the front face of the saddle tank. These holes were 
spotted from the template prepared at the time when the bushes were set-out on 
the tank. The cone shaped feeders at the bottom of the boxes were shaped and fly 
cut to radius then through-drilled for the sand flow. Pipe flanges were prepared 
and drilled at the same time as the feeder cones to ensure a good fit on final 
assembly. 

Filler caps and flanges proved to be simple turning jobs and one of those little 
tasks that give so much enjoyment in obtaining the correct curves. These are 
achieved using a graver held on a bar secured under the clamping shoe of the top 
slide, and finished, dare I say, by filing in the lathe! 

The operating lever with a boss at one end and at the other a tapped hole 
providing a fixing for the pivot bolt connection with the pull rod was prepared 
from mild steel. The pull rod itself is a length of 1/8 inch diameter mild 
steel rod terminating in an eye for the pivot bolt at one end and yet another ' 
Victorian cupboard handle ' at the other. The travel of this pull rod is limited 
by a strategically placed split pin which bears against the weather plate in the 
extreme rearward position. Small cranks and a dart valve inside each box control 
the flow of sand to the copper sandpipes which extend to the track level and are 
supported at one spot by pipe brackets bolted to the main frame members. 

### Clacks And Dummy Injectors

Feed water on Pixie is introduces via clack valves positioned where the 
prototype injectors are installed. Clacks are efficient and provide trouble free 
running. Lately time has permitted the production of dummy injectors which fit 
into the bosses on the boiler and replicate injectors for show purposes. These 
dummy injectors, whilst outwardly similar to the prototype, are in reality clack 
valves in disguise. they are soldered up assemblies of pieces filed from 
gunmetal offcuts from other operations. The screwed cap permits the installation 
of a spring and ball valve just as in standard valve. At a later date a working 
injector will be installed under the footplate. 

### Boiler Feed By-Pass Valve

An extra not to be found on the prototype is a feedwater by-pass valve. On Pixie 
this is mounted on the left hand frame member in the space between the back of 
the bunker and the boiler cleading. It is unobtrusive in this position, yet 
easily accessible. The valve itself is an essential brought about by the axle 
mounted water pump and the setting has to be monitored in steam to prevent 
over-feed and priming. That is if the driver wishes to avoid the ' hot shower ' 
which will otherwise result! 

### The Waterworks

Below and at the rear of the saddle tank, feeds are taken to the axle pump 
located behind the front beam and the hand pump sited in the left hand bunker. 
From the pumps the feed goes to the boiler, that from the axle pump via the 
by-pass valve. Sited below the front of the saddle tank is a balance pipe which 
also serves for emptying the tank. On Pixie this is extended and the shut-off 
valve is, for convenience, accessed below the level of the main frame member.

### Regulator Block And Gland

A search through the scrapbox revealed some short lengths of gunmetal, chucking 
pieces from a previous model, these were to form the body and gland. The 
machining involved is similar to that for any gland assembly, the body being a 
slide fit in the large bush on the backhead, secured in place using threaded and 
shouldered studs. Nuts on the threaded part of the stud tighten the gland into 
its recess. An ' O ' ring was installed into a groove behind the flange of the 
regulator body so as to bear on the boiler bush and ensure a steam tight joint. 
' O ' Rings, whether standard or purpose-made from a kit feature more and more 
in model engineering and, provided the manufacturer's limits on groove sizes and 
fits are observed give trouble-free service. 

The regulator rod in rustless steel locates into a hole in the regulator within 
the dome and is maintained in position by a tiny bush of the same material 
which, pinned to the rod, bears against the back of the regulator body at the 
backhead. Some small allowance is necessary to avoid any tendency towards 
binding due to expansion in service. The gland slides within the block, guided 
by the threaded studs, here again an ' O ' ring forms an excellent steam tight 
joint with little or no effort applied to the nuts. 

The regulator lever and handle, ( sometimes seen on the prototype with the 
handle facing rear-wards and sometimes facing forwards ) is from mild steel and 
the travel of the lever is limited by an angular shroud fitted with stops at the 
perimeter of the face of the block. Some experiment was required to ensure that 
the limits imposed by the shroud allowed the full travel of the actual regulator 
disc on the Stroudley type regulator within the steam dome 

### The Regulator

A number of reasons prompted the choice of a Stroudley type regulator, not the 
least was the straightforward construction and positive action. A further factor 
was that access for maintenance could be simply achieved via. the steam dome. 
These considerations have been bourn out in service although the fixing method 
would be revised in a further model. Being reluctant to drill the boiler to 
provide a fixing for the regulator the fastening is is made through the steam 
dome, using stainless steel bolts. This necessitates some juggling at the time 
of assembly and would, in a rebuild, be modified to the more conventional fixing 
using a strap screwed to the boiler shell. 

Gunmetal was used for the body of the regulator, and the two valve discs. The 
body was drilled to provide the vertical steamway then sealed with screwed 
plugs. The fixed disc and two fixing brackets were silver soldered onto the body 
at one heating. The steamway was drilled through the disc and the hole for pivot 
stud drilled and tapped. Care was taken to remove the burrs formed in these 
drilling operations as they would otherwise prevent the valve disc from making a 
steam tight joint with the fixed disc. A ' vee ' notch was filed in the edge of 
the hole in the fixed disc to assist in providing gradual opening of the port as 
the regulator was opened in service. The hole for the steam pipe was next 
drilled and tapped. The loose disc was then prepared, being drilled a close 
clearance on the pivot pin. Holes were drilled and tapped for the linkage bolts. 
These were threaded such that when fully inserted into the holes in the loose 
disc they provided ' pinch-free fit ' when passed through the holes in the 
actuating rods. All screws and pins are stainless steel and all are drilled and 
secured using stainless wire to prevent loosening in service. The spring 
maintaining contact between the valve faces is of stainless wire wound-up around 
a pin in the 3 jaw, only a light spring is required here as steam pressure does 
the job in service. The actuating levers are from rustless steel as is the 
rocker bar. This fits onto a square formed on the end of the regulator rod, 
being retained by a nut threaded onto the rod. The rod terminates in the rounded 
spigot which engages in the regulator body. 

### Chimney

The chimney was turned from a piece of reinforcing steel culled from the scrap 
heap on a building site. It was set in the 3 jaw, drilled using the largest 
available drill bit, then bored out. The boring tool used was an adaptation of a 
design published in MODEL ENGINEER many years ago and described later in this 
book. This has the advantage that it can be entered into small bores and, when 
modest cuts are taken, provides a a long reach without chatter. The tool uses 
small diameter cutters which can be produced from the remains of broken centre 
bitts. As with all long tools however it is essential that a number of fine 
finishing cuts are made to counteract inaccuracy resulting from the spring of 
the shank holding the tool. 

The outer taper was turned in several stages, setting the top slide to the 
required angle and moving the saddle and locking it at each intermediate 
position. A small rebate was formed at the top of the piece to locate the cap, 
and, prior to parting-off to finished length, a similar rebate formed to seat 
into the chimney base. The cap and base castings were next machined to the 
required profile with the necessary rebate and projection to ensure a good 
register between the parts at the time of soldering the joints. 

The chimney cap was turned from a piece of gunmetal, set in the 3 jaw. It was 
bored and the joggle formed for the joint with the chimney body. The curved 
surfaces were shaped offhand, using a tool supported by a piece of stock bar set 
in the tool post. Once bored and profiled the cap was then parted off. The 
bottom casting was turned, again with a joggle for locating the chimney body and 
the plain portion above the flair turned circular. The part was then set on the 
vertical slide for fly-cutting to match the radius of the smokebox. This was 
facilitated by using a washer and one of the medium Myford tee bolts set into 
the slot in the vertical slide. as in all such operations the slide was packed 
from the topslide to eliminate movement and avoid chatter. Finally the flair was 
ground and filed to shaped. Enthusiasts may wish to produce their parts by 
spinning or raising them from gilding metal. This is, it seems, an aquired art 
and presents a rather daunting prospect to the tyro. 

The three parts were joined by silver soldering and the base drilled for the 
bolts to fix it in position onto the smokebox. As is the case when soldering 
boiler tubes, several small nicks in the joining surfaces will assist the flow 
of solder into the joint. 

The petticoat pipe was spun-up from a piece of copper pipe, an offcut from the 
last plumbing job carried out in the house. Frequent annealing permitted the 
lower end to be expanded to a profile in line with the recommendations in 'The 
manual of Model Locomotive Construction' by Martin Evans. The upper end is a 
push-fit into the chimney and stays secure with the aid of a dab of instant 
gasket. Whilst on the face of things this may seem to be a pretty tenuous means 
of fitting it permits the petticoat pipe to be withdrawn when access is required 
to the otherwise congested smokebox. 

### Steam Dome

The steam dome on any locomotive is a joy to produce. Whether turned from a 
casting, from solid material or spun to shape by the more adventurous and 
proficient model engineer the dome has to be a thing of beauty. The fortunate 
model engineer may find a suitable casting in the stocks of his local supplier. 
He may through perusing the details in articles in the model press find a dome 
casting that nearly matches his requirements and can be doctored to provide the 
required form. It was Henry Moore the celebrated sculptor who pointed to a 
massive piece of material and said that the form he wanted was ' in there 
somewhere ' ! The dome on PIXIE has been fabricated from thin sheet metal and 
fortunately there is a joint in the material just below the convex curve at the 
top. In the case of Pixie this permits a turned dome being produced in two 
pieces, the lower from an offcut of steel of unknown parentage, probably a 
cropping from a stockists scrapbox, the upper a cast piece of gunmetal. Assembly 
from two pieces of material also facilitated the cutting of the opening for the 
base of the safety valve assembly. 

A length of bar for the lower dome was cut by hand from the billet of steel.... 
blood and sweat ! The length required was determined bearing in mind the flare 
which fits over the cleading. This was then set in the 3 jaw chuck and a length 
slightly less than the dimension from the top of the flair to the top of the 
parallel portion of the dome was turned to finished diameter. A small rebate was 
formed in the end to provide a location for the dome top section. The blank was 
then turned in the chuck, gripped by the reduced section and the remainder 
turned to to the diameter of the finished flair. The body was then bored out to 
clear the inner dome. 

Whilst means of producing the flair by milling alone have been described by 
Martin Evans, the tyro will find that the simplest solution to the somewhat 
knotty problem of the geometry involved will be to turn the upper, external 
concave shape which is viewed in the side elevation of the finished dome, fly 
cut the seating to match the boiler cleading ( NOT the boiler itself ) then mill 
away the evidently surplus material before finally finishing up with a 
succession of files. Ideally the edges of the flare should be very thin to 
replicate the prototype, this is easier said than done and the individual must 
work to HIS predetermined standard. Again a template will assist in achieving 
the correct profile. 

Following the sequence described above, the base of the dome was fly-cut to the 
profile of the cleading. The part-machined blank was mounted on the vertical 
slide using bolts passed into the tee grooves via a washer fitted into the inner 
dome recess. In instances such as this where material is to be machined whilst 
attached to the vertical slide, particularly where there is any amount of 
overhang, some packing should be used to augment the support provided by the 
bolts or clamps. A piece of stock bar and some small blocks secured between the 
piece to be machined and the top slide will provide such support This precaution 
will be appreciated when for example the heavier of the intermittent cuts of a 
fly cutter are experienced. Once again, a reminder .... when fly cutting, first 
set the cutter to describe a radius greater than the required finished radius 
and then slowly reduce the radius of the cut, whilst advancing the piece, until 
the eventual diameter is achieved. Frequent checking against a template will 
ensure a good fit. 

With the seating shape generated, the excess material was milled away and the 
final form achieved by filing, taking care not to remove too much material in 
any one place at a time. The filing operations were eased by mounting the dome 
blank onto a mandrel secured in the vice at the workbench. Final polishing 
produced an acceptable lower dome ready for drilling for the various valves 
which adorn the prototype. 

Pixie's upper dome was produced by straightforward turning, finished freehand 
using a tool bearing upon a length of stock bar set in the toolpost. The part 
was then set, protected by paper at each jaw in the 3 jaw for the inner profile 
and the locating tongue to be turned. Later the plan profile of the the safety 
valve base was set out on the top of this piece using lines scribed in marking 
blue and the opening milled for final filing to fit at the time of erection. 

### Safety Valves

The safety valves on PIXIE sit on top of the steam dome. This arrangement is 
replicated in Pixie by two valve bodies, containing the valve seatings, which 
pass through a shaped block into bushes in the top of the inner steam dome. A 
turned pillar which provides the fulcrum for the spring retaining beam is 
mounted on the block. When the valves lift, exhausting steam is directed away 
above the roof of the locomotive by two polished brass pipes slotted to fit over 
the retaining beam. These pipes seat upon a shoulder turned onto the valve seat 
bushes and are supported by a mild steel bracket bolted to the roof. 

Where two safety valves are fitted, and this is recommended, they should be set 
to blow at the same pressure. Failing this the higher of the two may never be 
actuated and may seize-up. 

In Pixie the valves are phosphor bronze balls drilled and tapped to accept 
stainless steel spindles. The seat for the balls was formed in the manner 
described by LBSC, a blow with a heavy hammer on a steel ball set onto the 
embryo seating. To avoid thread damage during this somewhat brutal procedure 
each valve bush in turn was screwed, as far as its shoulder, into a tapped hole 
in a substantial piece of bar. Valve springs were wound from stainless steel 
wire and were tested using a simple loading rig as described in an article by ' 
Laurie ' Lawrence on ' SAFETY VALVES AND A FEW OTHER SAFE ODDS AND ENDS ' in 
Model engineer Vol. 162 No.3847 of May 1989 

### Retro-Fitted Pump Eccentric

The axle driven pump is, of course, quite unprototypical in the case of Pixie, 
although as with most things connected with locomotion, there are prototypical 
examples of the use of axle pumps. However, in view of often encountered 
comments regarding substandard performance of injectors with ' warm ' water an 
axle driven pump is mounted behind the front plate. Later experiments may result 
in this being discarded in favour of an injector. With subsequent removal of the 
pump in mind, and as the wheels are bonded onto the axles, the pump eccentric is 
clamped and pinned to the leading axle. 

The standard pump is mounted on a pair of tapered blocks behind the front plate 
using countersunk headed screws. The inclination of the blocks lines the pump 
with the axle. A blank for the eccentric tumbler was first produced from a piece 
of stock bar, this was left oversize for eventual finish turning and the 
machining of the locating groove for the eccentric sheave. A length of bar of 
sufficient section to incorporate the clamping bolts was squared-up on all four 
faces. This block was drilled for clamping bolts. One of the faces was 'raised' 
by centre pop marks to ensure full penetration of the solder into the joint, and 
the block then silver soldered into position on the tumbler disc with regard to 
the approximate axle centreline. The assembly was then split by sawing, the sawn 
faces lightly cleaned up and the whole re-assembled to enable the axle hole to 
be drilled then bored. With the hole bored a thou or so undersize, the assembly 
could now be clamped onto a stub of material of the same diameter as the axle, 
mounted in the four jaw, offset by the throw of the eccentric. Now the eccentric 
was machined to final shape including the projecting guide. Later, during 
erection, the eccentric assembly was pinned to the axle using a short length of 
silver steel, this was inserted into a hole drilled through the clamping block. 
The eccentric thus produced works efficiently and can be removed when an 
injector is fitted in due course. 

The eccentric strap was a standard casting intended for another locomotive. The 
lugs were drilled for the assembly bolts, the assembly sawn into two parts, 
re-assembled then faced and the inner radius and guide groove bored, to match 
the tumbler which was frequently offered up to ensure a nice fit. The strap was 
then clamped onto a stub of stock material for the other face to be machined. 
Provision of an oil cap on one lug and milling the halved joint for the 
eccentric rod completed the part. Binding between the tumbler and the completed 
strap was eased by some judicious application of grinding paste then metal 
polish followed by a good wash and scrub with scouring powder and detergent ! 

LBSC's words and music provided the basis of the method used to produce the 
drain cocks. The principle operation here was not that of machining the valve 
bodies but rather the manufacture of a tapered reamer for forming the valve 
seatings. The technique involved setting the top slide to the correct 
inclination and turning not only the tapered plugs but also a reamer in silver 
steel for forming the seating within the body of the valve. The reamer was then 
filed to shape and tempered. The cross hole in the body of the valve was drilled 
undersize and then reamed to what must then to be the correct taper for the 
plug. The ' thin ' end of the plug was then threaded for the retaining nut and 
washer and the ' thick ' end squared-up for the attachment of the operating 
lever. A little ' running-in ' with a small amount of grinding paste ensured a 
tight valve although all traces of the paste had to be removed using scouring 
powder then detergent. On Pixie very small diameter tubes are superglued into 
the valve outlets to direct the wet steam away from the loco with the drain 
cocks in the open position. 

### Steam Actuated Cylinder Drain Valves

When first encountered PIXIE was fitted with steam actuated drain cocks. These 
are operated from the footplate by a valve similar to that found on the outlet 
of Victorian tea urns, a valve of character ! The actuating cylinder is mounted 
behind the front beam, the piston rod connecting to the cockshaft via a link and 
lever. The bar connecting the drain cocks on the right hand side of the 
locomotive has a tension spring which keeps the cocks open / closed according to 
the setting of the valve on the weather plate. 

A short stub of gunmetal was turned then bored for the cylinder, quite fun as it 
is only just about an inch overall. A cylinder cover was turned to suit and 
bored for the piston rod. The piston and rod were prepared all as those for the 
engines, and the whole assembled using 8 BA bolts. The cylinder is mounted 
behind the front beam on an angle bracket, forked around the steam inlet union, 
again using small bolts. The crank, pivot and lever connecting to the cock 
provided some watchmaking experience, the lever being pinned to the cockshaft 
which is set in tiny bearing bosses on the frames.

### Platework, Tanks And Bunkers

The saddle tank dimensions having been established from the survey of the 
prototype a start was made by constructing a card and plywood mock-up. Plywood 
end panels, 3 / 8 inch thick, generated the curves of the platework which in 
this mock-up was represented by thick cardboard. One of the plywood dummy ends 
was later used as a template when cutting a piece of 3 / 8 inch mild steel plate 
to be used as a flanging plate. Provision of the mock-up enabled an early trial 
fit to be made to confirm that the finished tank constructed to the measurements 
taken at site would seat properly on the components of the model erected so far.

Blocks of wood set upon the frame angles to simulate the tank-support angle 
brackets enabled dimensions to be established for the location of angle brackets 
which would eventually be brazed to the boiler shell. The position of the curved 
steel angle support connecting the tank to the smokebox could likewise be 
established. Messrs. Reeves' asbestos-free lagging material was to be used in 
conjunction with cleading and boiler bands of brass sheet. The mock up confirmed 
that there was sufficient space between the underside of the tank and the boiler 
for these items. With key dimensions of the model components established, work 
could be commenced on the tank proper. 

### Flanging The Plates

It was decided to use mild steel plate for the tank rather than brass sheet 
which would have been the alternative. By making a few trial sections of flanges 
which included both convex and concave curves it was established that, with 
care, 16 gauge mild steel could be flanged cold without loss of flatness of the 
plane parts of the platework. This could be achieved provided that, whilst 
flanging, the plate was sandwiched between the 3 / 8 inch template and a stiff 
piece of plate slightly smaller than the flat part of the template. As the 
flanges were formed it became necessary to snip out excess material from the 
flange at the convex corners in order to avoid cockling and to provide a smooth 
land for the wrapper plate. A touch of weld-metal sealed the flange at these 
points. With care the metal could be spread sufficiently to accomodate the 
concave curves where the tank sits over the smokebox and boiler cleading. 

In the prototype, due to the riveted construction and the lapping of plates, it 
was necessary to form a joggle in the flanges to accommodate the extra layer of 
plate at the lap joint adjacent to the bottom corner of each side. This was also 
necessary in the model, it was achieved by setting the plate into the twin vices
, and using two substantial backing bars together with two offcut pieces of 
plate of thickness equivalent to that of the tank plating. With the offcut 
pieces of plate positioned either side of the tank plate, above and below the 
position of the joggle, the vices were tightened in unison and the offset or 
joggle in the tank plate thus formed as it would be in a press. A considerable 
amount of ' presswork ' can be carried out in the vice although of course the 
bigger the vice, the better for such applications. When folding or pressing, the 
workpiece should always be supported using quite heavy backing bars, in this way 
twist and distortion will be avoided. 

### Sandbox Fixings

At this stage fixings for the sandboxes were inserted into the front flanged 
plate, these consisted of brass bushes of 'top-hat' configuration in which blind 
holes were tapped to receive bolts which would be passed through the back of 
the sandbox. These bushes, as well as providing a secure fixing for the 
sandboxes served to space the sandbox from the front plate. The holes for the 
fixing sockets were drilled to template, the template then set aside for future 
use in drilling corresponding holes in the sand boxes, a small note was scribed 
on the templates as a ' reminder ' to reverse the templates when applied to the 
back of the boxes ! 

### Wrapper Plates

The tank wrapper plates were formed using suitably sized bars from stock set in 
the twin vices at the dirty bench. Packings sitting on the bed of the vice 
located two bars, one the radiussed bar which actually formed the bend, the 
other a square section bar to maintain the flatness of the plate. Timber drifts 
used driven by a builders ' lump ' hammer persuaded the plate to take up the 
right form. The certain way to generate blemishes in folded platework, when not 
using a folding tool, is to use too light a hammer when bending or flanging. 
Blemishes are also formed if the face or edge of a hammer is allowed to come 
into contact with the plate. It is essential that clean barstock, free from 
blemishes is used for the formers, otherwise blemishes will be transferred into 
the plate being folded. A hardwood block should always be interposed between the 
plate and the hammer as the metal plate is bent. The combination of hammer blows 
and pressure applied to the plate by the free hand ensures the desired curve 
being generated. With some steels, particularly stainless steel, it will be 
necessary to over-bend the plate slightly to allow for elastic recovery although 
care is needed to avoid forming a local kink beyond the freshly formed curve. 

Difficulty can be experienced in correctly gauging the width of plates which are 
to be folded to fit into, or around, concave or convex flanges. It it is 
advisable to start with an overwide piece of plate which can be trimmed to size 
on completion of the folding operation. The approximate width of such plates can 
be established by bending a piece of fairly stiff wire around the flanged plate, 
straightening it, then making some small allowance for the effects of the bends 
to establish the cutting width. With the folding operation completed any excess 
can be cut away. In the course of forming wrapper plates frequent checking 
against the flanged plates is necessary to ensure a good fit. It is important to 
make index marks on the flanged plates and wrapper to ensure that the wrapper is 
located in the same place each time a trial fit is made. Temporary marks of this 
nature are best made with a ' Permanent ' grade of pen as used for overhead 
projectors. The marks can be removed using methylated spirits and a scrap of 
rag. Trial fits should be made against each end plate as, when using rolls, 
particularly when using makeshift ' bending rolls ' lacking control of 
parallelity, there may be some small difference between the two ends of the 
wrapper plates. 

### Tank Assembly

The tank currently mounted on PIXIE has been fabricated by welding, with dummy 
rivets, a grand job it is too! However, as locomotive was to be modelled as it 
was the first time it coasted into Pages Park Station on the Leighton Buzzard 
Narrow Gauge Railway, it had to be a fully riveted assembly on Pixie! In order 
that the rivetting process could be carried out on all visible joints it was 
decided that a closing plate would be introduced into the curved underside of 
the tank. When all had been riveted up this plate was to be inserted and secured 
by countersunk screws into tapped holes in butt straps along the joint. Being on 
the underside of the tank these would not be visible in the finished model. 

Rivetting was carried out commencing with the installation of the tank front. 
Fortunately, in the prototype the flange on the backplate of the tank is located 
rearward-looking and these rivets can be inserted and formed last. Soft iron 
rivets were used, a dolly being set in the vice to enable the innermost rivets 
to be reached. As with all riveted joints it is essential that the plates being 
joined are held tightly together to avoid the rivet shanks distorting and 
actually spacing the plates apart. Rivet holes should be marked by a scribed 
line and set out along the line using dividers. Apart from satisfying the ' 
rivet counting brigade ', accuracy of line and spacing have a considerable 
effect on the appearance of the finished model, and any inaccuracy on the tanks 
or bunkers which form a prominent feature of many narrow gauge locomotives can 
detract from otherwise good quality workmanship. Once the holes in the wrapper 
are drilled the flanged plate can be set into position and two holes 
transfer-drilled from the wrapper. Two small bolts through these holes will then 
hold the plates in the correct location whilst the remainder of the drilling is 
carried out. 

The reconstructed tank on the prototype has an access panel let into the tank 
top. In the model advantage was taken of this feature to enable access for 
lining the tank with Fiberglass for durability purposes. When laying up the 
fibreglass in the tank BONDAGLASS pre-wetted glassfibre tape was used to ensure 
a good fit into the corners Pre-wetting avoids a problem well known to 
laminators, that of air becoming trapped between the composite lining and the 
base material at angles. Entrapped air makes it difficult to fully ' wet out ' 
the glassfibre. At this stage a baffle was glassed into position across the tank 
below the filler opening to prevent water in the tank surging backwards and 
forwards when the model is started and stopped in service. 

### Filler Cap And Pipe Flanges

The tank filler cap flange was turned from gunmetal as was the cover. The cover 
was made a push-fit on the flange to avoid problems in service. These activities 
are great fun, especially the reproduction of detail such as the very 
domesticated knob on the filler cap ! After fixing the filler cap flange by 
rivetting the underside of the panel was primed and painted. The panel was then 
secured by screws into flanges fixed to the underside of the tank top. 

Balance pipe and feed pipe connection flanges were fixed into position on the 
wrapper using countersunk screws into tapped holes, a seal being achieved using 
Araldite. Once the Araldite had cured, the holes in the flanges guided the 
drills used to penetrate the tank . Where a mating flange is required, for the 
feed pipes for example, good matching fits can be achieved if these items are 
prepared at the same time as those for the tank. Pairs of flanges drilled and, 
if necessary, tapped at the same time ensure an accurate fit when they are 
eventually fixed together when the plumbing is installed. Flanges pre-prepared 
in this fashion should be marked according to location ( and orientation ) and 
stored safely for later use. 

### Tank Mountings

The tank is located and fixed at the smokebox using a radiussed steel angle, 
connection being made by bolts passing through the tank front and through the 
top of the smokebox. Attempts to form this by heating a piece of angle then 
bending it around a former failed, due to distortion of the section. This 
problem was solved by producing a simple plaster pattern from which a local 
foundry produce a suitable casting. This casting was set on the lathe faceplate 
and turned to finished section and radius. The angle is quite prominent on the 
model and, whilst this solution amounted to the ' use of a sledge-hammer to 
crack a nut ', the correctly shaped mounting enhances the overall appearance of 
this part of the locomotive. An alternative would have been to rough-saw the 
shape from the solid and then turn it to final form. On the model only two bolts 
are actually used in fixing the angle to the tank front, the rest are simulated 
by nuts run onto studs set in the angle. Similarly only two bolts actually 
penetrate the smokebox, the remainder being dummies. In the case of this fixing, 
as in many instances encountered in model making, absolute replication of 
fixings and fastenings is unnecessary for the purposes of strength and may even 
complicate final assembly and later maintenance. 

The rear of the tank is located and retained by studs set into mounting plates 
on the underside of the tank, these pass through holes in the brackets on the 
boiler shell, these holes are slotted to cater for movement as the boiler heats 
and cools. The plates on the underside of the tank were fixed using countersunk 
screws into the wrapper plate, the joint being anointed with Araldite before the 
mounting was fixed. The fixing studs project downwards through hardwood blocks, 
which exist for insulation purposes. Teak blocks are used on the model and these 
allow a small amount of adjustment to overcome inaccuracies in the level of the 
tank assembly measured at the time of erection. 

Two holes were drilled in the upper flanged joint at the rear of the tank. These 
are required for bolts fixing the stay-rods to the weather board, or as it might 
be termed on other locomotives, the spectacle plate! These two holes are 
coincident with the pitch of the rivets at this point. 

### Priming

It is most enjoyable to see a model develop in gleaming raw metal, be it steel, 
cast iron or gunmetal, and there is always a reluctance to follow what is 
perhaps the more usual sequence of priming, undercoating and painting parts as 
the work of production and erection proceeds. It has to be admitted however that 
there is little worse than entering the workshop and finding that surfaces, 
which the previous evening had exhibited a satisfying shine, are marred by 
embryo rusty fingerprints ! It is difficult enough to prepare metal around rows 
of rivets for priming, without having to remove such evidence. In view of the 
mild steel construction it was decided to prime the finished tank before 
storage. Accordingly, the tank was spray coated with a rust preventative paint, 
' BONDAPRIMER '; this is a resin based paint containing zinc which has good 
covering powers and dries quickly to a uniform matt finish. This was a drastic 
step as painting a model is not something to be attempted lightly ! Experience 
has proved that this was the right course to adopt, the primer warded off the 
dreaded rust and provided a hard base for subsequent coatings, although they 
were applied many months later. More about the painting process anon! 

### Coal Bunkers

The coal bunkers presented another folding job. This time a flanging plate was 
produced to the dimensions of the inside of the main face of the bunker. Two 
suitably sized pieces of stainless steel plate were prepared to the correct 
height of the bunker. The plate to be folded was sandwiched between the flanging 
plate and a substantial piece of plate from stock, this was cut just slightly 
smaller than the flat on the flanging plate. This ' sandwich ' was then gripped 
in the vice and force applied via. a hardwood block. Care was taken when 
applying the force to start close to the stock plate to achieve the necessary 
tight bend. To overcome difficulty experienced in gripping the small amount of 
plate projecting from the sandwich this was held between two further pieces of 
stock held by a ' mole ' wrench which allowed hand pressure to be applied. With 
the bends completed a check was made on a true surface to ensure that the whole 
assembly sat flat and that the back and front were perpendicular to the base. 
Any slight twist in the formed plate was adjusted at this stage before the back 
and front edges of each bunker was trimmed to the correct length. 

The top edge of each bunker is trimmed by a beading. A length of 5 / 16 inch 
diameter rod was milled filed to the correct 'D' section ( filing would have 
sufficed ), bent to match the top edge of each bunker and then riveted into 
position. The openings at the bottom of each bunker were chain drilled and sawn 
to shape prior to fitting steel angles at the edges which would abut the back 
plates. Similar angle was fixed to the bottom edge of each folding and to the 
back plates for use in fixing the bunkers to the footplates. Before rivetting 
these joints, plates were cut to the correct profile to fit into the bunkers. It 
was decided to mount the boiler feedwater pump in the left hand bunker and that 
plate was slotted accordingly. The left hand bunker was chosen for the pump 
location as this would free the right hand for the ticklish work of stoking 
through the dimunitive firehole door ! Later a hole would need to be drilled for 
the feedwater pipe although at this stage in construction the exact position of 
the hole was not known. As stainless steel had been used in constructing the 
bunkers these could be left in their pristine, shiny state until the time came 
for the final paint job . A word here about working stainless steel. Many are 
the broken bitts that testify to difficulties encountered in drilling ( not to 
mention tapping! ) stainless steel. The secret appears to be that any tool used 
to fashion stainless must be kept cutting at all times it is in contact with the 
metal. Considerable heat is developed the moment the tool rubs rather than cuts, 
and the temper is lost or the tool jams with dire results in case of the small 
drills we use. Hundreds of rivet holes in stainless plate have proved the wisdom 
of using an anti-scuff paste as a lubricant. This combined with working the tool 
hard by applying plenty of force to the feed avoids tool wear, heating and 
damage 

### The Weather Board / Spectacle Plate

The platework forming the front of the rather spartan cab provides some 
interesting work in shaping the plate itself and fabricating the angle steel 
supporting frame. This is mostly straightforward, fashioning material prepared 
according to measurements from the survey into model form. The angle supports 
presented a problem as far as bending the metal without distorting the section. 
The difficulty was ovecome in this instance by cutting a disk of plate of the 
scale thickness of the angle and turning from this a complete circle of material 
of angle section. Segments of this section were then cut as required to meet the 
geometry of the support frame. The roof bearer was of sufficiently large radius 
to be bent cold in the vice. The curved segments, uprights and the roof bearer 
were clamped to a ply template and silver soldered. After this the plate could 
be clamped into position and the whole assembly drilled and bolted up. 

### The Scale Roof And The Driving Roof

Two roofs were made, one for exhibition purposes, the other for use when the 
locomotive is working. the latter has an opening which permits a good view of 
the 'works', the gauges and access to the firehole door and the regulator. 
Stainless steel plate was used here, with rectangular section bar stiffeners 
riveted at all edges, using the right number of rivets ! Correct curvature was 
achieved using blocks of wood, a clean length of scaffold tube and foot power. 
The plate was set upon the blocks cut to the correct rise on the chord and the 
scaffold tube applied ' rolling pin fashion ' by the sole of the shoe. Heath 
Robinson as this may seem, both roofs fit comfortably onto the roof bearer for 
bolting into position, and both roofs are completely interchangeable ! Provision 
was made in each case for the two bolts to which the support plate for the two 
brass columns of the safety valves was to be attached. 

### The Scale Back And The Driving Back

As with the roofs, two backs were fabricated, one for driving purposes and the 
other for exhibition. The scale back or rear spectacle plate ( which, due to in 
service modifications to the locomotive, may not replicate the back currently 
fitted to the prototype ), was built to the dimensions achieved from the survey 
soon after I first saw the locomotive. It comprises a framework of angles and a 
curved roof bearer, silver soldered together and clad with plate. Holes for the 
glazing were trepanned from the plates whilst they were mounted on the vertical 
slide, absolute care being taken to ensure that the face of the slide was set 
dead square to the lathe axis. This was ensured by placing one edge of a steel 
rule against the chuck face and bringing the face of the vertical slide tight 
against the other prior to tightening the bolts securing it to the topslide. A 
suitably shaped tool was ground-up for the fly cutting tool holder providing the 
nearest radius to the required opening. Bearing in mind the maxim that the tool 
must be kept cutting at all times the saddle was fed towards the cutter, 
propelled by the tail stock quill. In such an operation it is advisable to 
tighten the saddle locking bolt slightly, and essential to interpose a piece of 
hard plywood between the metal being worked and the topslide. 

The glazing is secured within the platework of the scale back by two turned 
rings, one pair cut from brass bar and the other from steel. These are of course 
of such size that when fixed, using small screws, they provide a rebate into 
which perspex glazing material can be fitted. The driving back is a simple open 
structure, again silver soldered with just side plating added to aid with 
rigidity along the main axis of the locomotive. A small angle provides a fixing 
for the brake standard.

### Footplates

On PIXIE the footplates are quite rudimentary. There is a plate which bears on 
angle steel brackets attached to the inside of the frames and two outer plates 
which are supported on brackets on the drag beam and cantilever brackets riveted 
to the outside of the frames below the bunkers. Stainless steel plate is used on 
the model, more drilling ! Angle steel stiffeners run around below the edge of 
the outer plates. The rather tight bend below the front of the bunkers can be 
formed by cutting a 90 degree ' vee ' from the flange and bending the material 
cold. Care is required here to ensure that bolting faces of the angle remain 
flat, this can be checked on a true surface as the bend is formed. The 
cantilever support brackets may be cut from angle steel or fabricated, I chose 
the latter course, adding the smaller angle for the footplate connection as on 
the prototype. 

The plate between the frames has an opening for the damper lever and a small 
cranked plate that engages with this lever to locate the damper in the required 
position. It is advisable to leave the cranking process until the correct angle 
can be be gauged to the slots in the lever. Small checkouts will be required in 
each of the footplates to accomodate the angle brackets at the junction between 
the drag beam and the main frame members. In the central plate the drain pipe 
from the water gauge and fixings for the brake standard have also to be 
accommodated. 

The ashpan and damper are important parts of the firing system. In Pixie they 
are constructed of stainless steel sheet and mild steel angle. The angles sit 
below the foundation ring of the boiler, located by stainless steel dowels set 
into tapped holes in the ring. The upper edge of the ashpan projects slightly 
into the firebox and thus provides support for the grate which is cut from a 
section of proprietary stainless steel grate material supplied by Messrs Spinks. 
A length of mild steel was milled, drilled and filed to shape and cut into four 
pieces to provide the hinge blocks into which a stainless steel hingepin is 
slipped. 

The damper is controlled by a lever projecting through the central footplate and 
retained by a small, joggled piece of plate. Any of three checkouts in the lever 
locate on this to provide three settings, one fully closed and two sizes of 
opening...high tech ! In service the position of the damper does make quite a 
difference to the state of the fire, closed down it allows the engine to simmer 
comfortably. 

### A Small Preview !

At this stage a 'mini-erection' can be carried out ! The cantilever brackets 
supporting the outer footplates can be installed and the outer footplates set 
into position and bolted into place. Next the bunkers can be positioned and the 
fixing holes drilled through from the fixing angles. Then the weather board and 
the backplate can be set up. The weather board bolts to the bunker front and the 
back to the drag beam. Now the roof can be installed and it is time to step back 
and admire the fruits of our labours so far!

### Note

*As this chapter proceeds the text describes the work in erection. Although this 
book is not of the ' words and music ' type produced by illustrious writers such 
as LBSC, Martin Evans, Keith Wilson and other extremely experienced model 
designers and builders, it is written with an understanding of the problems that 
face the newcomer. It is hoped that the approach adopted will assist newcomers 
to model locomotives in their efforts.* 

*Whilst the reader may be building a model of another prototype the principle 
procedures stand.* 

### Erection

This is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the construction process, when at 
last the fruits of one's labours take finished form. The work of erection will 
be eased if the builder has access to both sides of the locomotive. Many 
builders employ an erection frame at this point in construction and there have 
been a number of examples in the various model publications. If the modeller 
intends to go along that route it is worthwhile making a frame that can be 
adjusted for use in subsequent maintenance operations, and indeed for further 
locomotive erection. End frames set upon an angle steel base can provide 
adjustment for length of locomotive, the ends being slid along the angles and 
clamped into position as required. A frame that permits the locomotive to be 
rotated and locked in any position is obviously going to be an asset although 
provided that the end frames are of square form and large enough to clear the 
projecting part of the locomotive this will permit access to the locomotive 
whilst the frame is set on its side or inverted. 

Mr J Bowman described a useful building stand in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 159 No 3805, 
August 1987, this was built using two scrap car jacks obtained from a breakers 
yard. Pivoted clamps provided attachment to the front and back beams of the 
locomotive. The jacking screw arrangement can be used to elevate the model to 
the required working height, as the designer says, opening-up useful bench space 
beneath the model. 

### Frames And Motion

With the frames inverted the axle sets are be dropped into position, including 
any springs or rubber parts of the suspension. The hornplates are installed, 
their bolts being anointed with a spot of fixing fluid. At this stage it is 
convenient to install an axle pump if one is to be fitted, the bolts connecting 
the parts of the eccentric strap again being given a touch of securing fluid. 
The cylinder blocks can be attached to the frames, remembering to insert 
insulation between the back of the block and the frame, where required. The 
motion plates are next, the bolts, or dummy rivets in the case of Pixie being 
inserted and taken up tight. The slide bars can then be installed between the 
seatings on the piston rod glands and the lug on the motion plate, not 
forgetting to install the crossheads, the correct way round. At this stage the 
geometry of the engines should be checked out. Careful measurement of the 
distances between the piston rod and the slide bar(s) at the extreme ends 
revealing whether the two are parallel. This adjustment is carried out on a full 
size locomotive by sighting through the centre-line of the cylinder or 
establishing the centre line using a taut wire then taking measurements in the 
same fashion. Any minor adjustments can be made by insertion of shim washers 
where the slide bars are attached to the motion plates. 

At this stage the cock shaft for the cylinder drain valves can be installed, as 
can the small steam actuating cylinder and cranks. The cylinder bolts behind the 
front plate on the right hand side of the locomotive. The straps linking the 
cocks can be installed. that on the right hand side of the locomotive having an 
extension for a return spring which is secured to an eye bolt through a plate 
projecting from below the front beam. 

Coupling rods, with marine bearings in the case of Pixie, are next. Some 
anti-scuff paste assists in sliding them home onto the crankpins. In the case of 
crankpins constructed incorporating the retaining flange, scale marine bearings 
can be split on the centreline of the crankpin and bolted-up. With dummy marine 
bearings, the leading end of the coupling rod can be secured by a countersunk 
cap sized to replicate the head of the crankpin. A nice detail in Martin Evans 
book ' Model steam locomotive construction ' shows the use of either a cap 
threaded onto the crankpin, or the use of a cap secured by an ' 0 ' BA Allen 
screw. Whichever is chosen, securing fluid ensures that the caps do not come 
loose in service. In the marine bearing the upper bolt must be that having the 
groove for lubricant. Each bolt has a full nut, half nut as a locknut and a 
split cotter pin for safety. With the rear coupling rod bearing assembly 
completed, the crossheads can be installed on the slide bars, including slipper 
plates as appropriate, and the piston rod / crosshead joint made using a cotter 
or bolts. 

The connecting rods can be positioned and gudgeon pins installed. On Pixie it is 
possible to drop the connecting rod by rotating the wheels to a position where 
the crosshead clears the wheel allowing the the gudgeon pin to be withdrawn from 
the back of the crosshead, this is helpful when it comes to routine maintenance. 
The gudgeon pins have single large nuts on the threaded portion, again safety 
split cotterpins are inserted. 

With the coupling rods installed, connecting rods secured within the crossheads 
and the cylinder drain cocks open and plenty of machine oil on all the moving 
parts the motion should turn over sweetly. In the event of any binding the 
bearings can be slackened one by one to find the offender when a touch with a 
fine file or insertion of a piece of shim stock sorts the problem. 

### Weighshaft And Valve Gear

The weighshaft brackets on PIXIE are fixed by bolts through the stiffening 
angles on the main frame and through the frames themselves. In the case of 
Hackworth valve gear the position of the centre of the weighshaft relative to 
the remainder of the motion is critical to the valve events and these have to be 
checked out prior to finally fixing the position of the weighshaft brackets. A 
check was made prior to constructing the valve gear by making a twice scale 
sized model in card, set up on the drawing board. The location of the brackets 
on Pixie is exactly as established from the survey and fortunately the positions 
and sizes of components thus determined provided, in conjunction with scale 
sized components, sufficient valve travel. 

The return is crank set on the rear crankpin, lined with the axle centre and 
both the bolts tightened. A spot of securing liquid assists in maintaining the 
correct position although with a well fitted, reamed hole in the return crank 
the locking bolts provide a remarkably strong connection. A variety of methods 
are employed to fix return cranks, ranging from pinned and bolted, slotted and 
bolted and simply bolted connections, each has its merits. That employed on 
Pixie is straightforward to make and effective in service. 

With the die blocks installed in their guides the vibrating lever can be set 
into place, the top secured by the pivot bolt in the die-block and the bottom by 
a cap with a countersunk screw. Next comes the installation of the valve rod. 
Here it should be mentioned that wherever a connection is made with a simple 
pivot pin, the pin should be retained by a split cotterpin. Holes for minute 
split pins tend to wander in the course of drilling through the fork and the 
pin, and some time can be expended in attempting to reinsert split pins after a 
service or routine maintenance. A small punched mark made when holes for such 
minute split pins are drilled through the forks and pins will identify the 
resident pins with the forks and also the correct orientation of those pins 
within the forks. 

### Reversing Lever

On many locomotive the reversing lever and sector plate can be assembled 
independent of any part of the superstructure. On Pixie this is not the case as 
the sector plate depends for support at each end from bolts through the inner 
face of the right hand bunker. To facilitate access and valve setting a 
temporary bracket was fabricated to provide support at these points and the 
lever and reach rod installed. The front end of the rod pivots on a stud secured 
into a lug on the bottom of the slide. The rear end of the rod, forks over the 
reversing lever which in turn, pivots on a fulcrum bolt on the bunker side, 
replicated on the the temporary bracket. There are occasions such as this when a 
temporary arrangement allows access for adjustment which would be difficult to 
make with everything permanently in place. This time the use of the temporary 
bracket permitted the notches for the latch to be marked before the stage of 
final erection. The notches were actually cut after removal of the bracket and 
final erection of the sector plate and bunker assembly onto the bunker side. 

### Valves And Valve Setting

The slide valves were dropped into place in the valve chest. The gland nuts were 
threaded onto the valve spindles which were inserted into the glands on the 
valve chest, not forgetting to insert the ' O ' ring packings. The rod was then 
passed through the first of the retaining collars, the slot in the valve, the 
second collar and then into the tail guide. Now the valve rod could be installed 
and the pins inserted. Valve setting followed the normal procedure of adjusting 
the position of the slide valve on the valve spindle, locking the collars when 
the optimum position had been established. 

It has to be remembered that the collars must allow the spindle freedom in the 
vertical direction such that steam pressure in the valve chest forces the valve 
onto the port face. Now the weighshaft brackets can be fixed into their final 
position, also the position of the notches on the sector plate can be marked in 
full forward and full reverse. 

In the event of a need to modify valve arrangements it is a great help if a set 
of perspex ' slide valves ' are produced. These can be simply made from 1 / 8" 
perspex sheet, joined by using plastic solvent. The exhaust recess can be 
scribed and coloured-in using marking blue. The dummy valves can be threaded 
onto the valve spindle and the events viewed as the locomotive is moved back and 
forth along a short length of test track. 

With the valves set the valve chest cover can be installed, it is advisable that 
all the studs should be inserted and the cover checked for location prior to 
finally inserting the gasket and tightening down the nuts. This will avoid the 
situation sometimes encountered where, due to minor inaccuracies in hole 
location, the cover binds on one of the many studs and fails to seat down 
properly ! For the cover / valve chest joint, liquid gasket has proved 
satisfactory in service, and certainly saves a considerable amount of work 
otherwise required in the manufacture of traditional gaskets. 

### A Trial Run On Air

At this stage it is more than likely that, with the the engines attached to the 
frame and with the motion work installed, the builder will want to have a trial 
run. This can be carried out at the bench on compressed air with the frames set 
upon packing. The writer felt the urge at this stage to prove the work to date. 
In the absence of a length of track Pixie's first run was on the floor of a 
local garage. The frames complete with motion and a temporary steam inlet pipe 
were taken to the garage, the only source at that time of an adequate supply of 
air. To the amazement of two young mechanics, who whilst having intimate 
knowledge of the workings of motor car engines were apparently ignorant on the 
working of steam, the ' mechanism ' shot twenty feet across the workshop floor 
on the end of the air line, like a scalded cat. Remarkably too, on resetting the 
reversing lever and opening the regulator it shot back again. The power 
developed by the small engines had to be seen to be believed. 

Such excitement! After more than seven years and much figuring and speculation 
as to the effects of scaling down parts of the valve gear, its geometry, the 
steam chest dimensions and the dozen or so components of each engine, the thing 
worked, and powerfully too. In retrospect the whole proposition of a concrete 
engineer manufacturing such a complex mechanism in miniature, and one that 
worked as intended on first trial, seemed as unlikely as the prospect of the 
construction industry, as we know it, putting a man into space! 

### Smokebox

The smokebox can be secured onto the saddle, here stainless steel bolts are 
advisable. These can be turned up from stainless steel hexagon stock of the 
appropriate size. It is a good thing to hold a stock of the common sizes of 
hexagon material in stainless for bolts, and brass for unions. When there are a 
few minutes to spare between other jobs, or when only a limited time can be 
allocated for the workshop, a few unions can be turned up or the odd bolt 
prepared without too much upheaval and without too much effort in setting up 
machinery. 

### Boiler

Boiler installation will render the space between the frames rather less than 
accessible so that it makes sense to insert any pipe runs and make-up any joints 
in those pipes before finally locating the boiler into the smokebox ring and 
seating it onto the bearing brackets on the frames. First attempts at boiler 
installation onto Pixies frames involved considerable sweat and no little amount 
of personal injury ! Despite the fact that the boiler matched the dimensions 
from the survey in every detail, ( indeed the accuracy achieved was a great 
credit to the builder ), the boiler just would not seat into position...... 
Enter Giant Despair ! ......Several cups of tea and a breather later however, on 
resuming what until then had been a struggle, the boiler suddenly slid into 
position as it has indeed on subsequent occasions. There may have been ' 
Gremlins ' in the workshop on the occasion of the first attempts at 
installation, although more likely the interference was caused by some rogue 
rivet head or overlong bolt, eased-in in the heat of subsequent operations. 

With the boiler installed a check should be made to see that the firebox end is 
free to move as everything heats up and the boiler expands. Holes in the 
bearing brackets need to be slotted to allow this movement as will those in 
brackets providing support for a saddle tank. The level of the boiler, relative 
to the frames, can also be checked and if necessary packings inserted at the 
bearing brackets. At this stage also, sufficient clearance can be established 
around blowdown valve(s) and if necessary any openings in stretchers adjusted 
as required. 

### Steam Pipe, Exhaust Pipes And Blower

Now the steam and exhaust pipes can be installed,. Some juggling is likely to be 
necessary to persuade these items into position through scale size apertures in 
the lower quarters of a smokebox ( Later thought was given to this and perhaps 
in a subsequent model, where some detail of the prototype is concealed in the 
model then some licence may be taken with sizes ! ) Eventually with such Chinese 
puzzles solved, the wet header can be bolted into place on the boiler bush ( not 
forgetting the 'O' ring seal ). The joints between the steam and exhaust pipe 
and the cylinder block can then made. Liquid gasket was used to seal these 
joints on Pixie and has proved perfectly effective in service. 

With the blower ring installed the plumbing can be completed. The parts of the 
pipes between apertures in the smokebox and the connections with the cylinder 
blocks are enclosed in a sheet steel cover, secured by tiny screws into tapped 
holes in the smokebox tube. To render the apertures airtight small quantities of 
modelling clay can be smoothed around the pipes from inside the smokebox using 
one of Messrs Proops ' Doofers '. These can be obtained from a MODEL ENGINEER 
exhibition stand and although they convey a fearsome reminder of time spent in 
the dentists chair will prove immensely useful about the workshop! 

### Regulator And Regulator Block

The regulator can be mounted within the steam dome, using stainless steel screws 
into the lugs on the regulator body. A check should be made at this stage to 
ensure that the screws on the actuating rods are wired to prevent them coming 
loose in service. Stainless steel wire is a must. 

With the regulator rod inserted into the regulator handle and the rod passed 
through the gland, the small bush can be set onto and secured to the rod by a 
stainless steel grub screw. This bears against the back of the body block, 
retaining the rod in its correct position within the regulator proper. The 
complete assembly can now be passed through the regulator block bush, the 
leading end being located in the back of the regulator body within the steam 
dome. 

### Safety Valves And Header Pipes

In the case of pixie, once the regulator and the regulator block and rod had 
been installed it was time to install the safety valve block and safety valve 
bodies. The block is in fact retained by the screwed portions of the valve 
bodies so that it became necessary to enlist the aid of the plastic gasket 
material once again. The fulcrum bracket which retains the safety valve balance 
beam screws into the safety valve block. The beam itself is mounted using a bolt 
as a pivot, the ends of the safety valve spindles move freely within bushes at 
the ends of the balance beam. Adjustment of the valves is achieved by screwed 
bushes set into those at the ends of the balance beam. Assembly of these items 
takes less time than is needed to write the description, although with such an 
important part of the ' works ' care has to be taken to ensure freedom of action 
of the parts. 

### Platework

There are three running plates on PIXIE. The two outer, low level plates take 
support from brackets rivetted to the main frame members and rails which are 
bolted to the drag beam. These plates provide seatings for the side bunkers, and 
importantly, the brake standard. These items are each in turn clamped into 
position and the location of the fixing screws transferred to the plates using a 
centre punch. If the platework is of stainless steel the holes for the fixing 
screws has to be drilled using a freshly sharpened bit with sufficient pressure 
to ensure that the bitt cuts metal all the time. As has been noted elsewhere, 
the slightest rubbing action will heat the bitt and spoil its temper. 

Once the lower running plates and the left-hand bunker are erected, the 
positions of the holes for the feedwater pipes from the hand pump in the left 
hand bunker can be established. Here pieces of stiff wire to replicate the pipes 
facilitates the marking process. The holes drilled the the pump can be installed 
on a mild steel block of sufficient height to bring the operating handle clear 
of the bunker ends at the extremes of the pump stroke. The brake standard is 
positioned on the right hand, lower running plate ( where it was located at the 
time of the survey, although there is evidence in the form of a set of mounting 
holes, that it has been set on the opposite side at some time in the 
locomotive's history ) and the fixing holes and the hole for the brake spindle 
spotted and drilled. 

The middle, upper footplate will require trimming to fit around the frame 
angles, also slotting for the damper lever. this is another situation where it 
is advisable to produce a strong card template and carry out a trial fit prior 
to cutting metal. Clearance for the angles joining the drag beam to the frame 
members is easy to arrange by pure measurement. To avoid wasteful errors in 
positioning the slot, the template can be slotted on the known line of the 
lever. Inserted into position, the card can be marked to indicate the position 
of the ends of the slot and the footplate marked and cut accordingly. A small 
metal catch is bolted to the plate to engage in, and retain, the damper lever. 
This was bolted into position on the footplate and with marking blue and a 
scriber the correct angle and depth of the three slots in the lever were 
established. Provision of one last slot for the drain pipe from the water gauge 
permitted the plate to be dropped into place. 

### Brake Standard, And Brake Gear

The main brake shaft with just the fixing bushes in place, was offered up and 
clamped into position, square across the frames and level. This allowed the 
cut-outs necessary to allow the bushes to seat onto the frame members to be 
determined, marked out, then cut and filed. The brake nut was then threaded onto 
the brake spindle and the handle rotated until the brake shaft complete with 
actuating arm, two bushes and two drop arms could be bolted into place. With the 
hangers and blocks installed by bolting to the frames, the pull rods could be 
inserted and the rods which serve as brake beams with their retaining bushes 
threaded into position. With all assembled the holes for the split pins which 
secure the bushes in place were drilled and the minute split cotterpins set into 
place. This size of split pin has extremely sharp ends, so beware! 

At the running plate two bolts pass through support angles on the standard 
downwards into the angles supporting the floor member. The screwed portion of 
the brake shaft can be engaged in the bush within the brake fork below the 
running board and the handle turned until the foot of the column contacts the 
floor when the fixing bolts can be installed. At the top, the brake standard 
takes support from the cab backplate support angle and is bolted into position 
using a shaped strap, reminiscent of a gutter bracket. 

### Ashpan And Grate

At the time of final erection the ashpan was set into position, clamped and 
blocked to prevent movement whilst the holes for retaining pins were drilled. 
After a lot of careful measurement, small diameter pilot holes were drilled 
through the mainframes and the ashpan sides. During the drilling of the holes a 
colleagues assistance was saught to sight the drill and ensure that the holes 
were put through horizontally. Transverse accuracy was obtained by lining the 
drill with a try-square set against the frames. The ashpan is located by two 
stainless pins, cross drilled for tommy bars at one end and tapered at the other 
to facilitate insertion. The pins themselves are retained by ' O ' Rings slipped 
into position once the pins are engaged. In the event of an emergency the grate 
can be dumped by withdrawing the pins when the ashcan will drop as far as the 
sleepers, spilling the fire. 

### Saddle Tank

With the boiler seated into position and the boiler / smokebox joint made, the 
fastening angle for the front of the saddle tank can be installed. Although 
there are a number of bolts through the angle and the smokebox tube, only two of 
these are in fact bolted connections, the rest are dummies, this to reduce the 
amount of work when dissembling for maintenance in future. On Pixie, the rear of 
the saddle tank rests on two brackets supported from the boiler casing and the 
front takes its support from the aforementioned bracket. Studs projecting from 
stiffening plates which also serve to reinforce the delivery pipe connection 
points from the tank, pass through timber blocks into the boiler brackets. the 
timber blocks are for insulation purposes. again the holes in the mounting 
brackets have to be slotted to permit expansive movement of the boiler. 

### Superstructure

After the arduous work of boiler and tank installation, the erection of the 
superstructure affords time to relax and enjoy ! The rather elementary weather 
plate is supported on angle steels which in their turn take support from the 
backs of the bunkers. The back of the cab, again platework on angle framing 
takes support from the drag beam. The weather board and cab back plating support 
the roof which is bolted to the curved angle steels forming the top of the 
superstructure framing. 

### Makers Plates

At this stage it was time to mount the makers plates ( which had been prepared 
earlier ! ) Mounted on each of the bunker sides these proclaim ' Kerr Stuart 
etc......" Plates such as these are essential in conveying the atmosphere of the 
model and some thought was given to their production. The method eventually 
adopted was first to choose a photograph of one plate from the reference shots 
on transparency film. This slide was then projected onto a sheet of paper set on 
the workshop wall and the image drawn-over using indian ink to approximately 
five times the size of the required plates. These were photographed by a friend, 
to provide the required image size, using a film having high contrast negative 
emulsion. The negative was then sent to Messrs Reeves for the production of 
etched plates. The detail was etched onto brass plate of the required thickness. 
All that was then necessary was to saw and file these to profile, polish the 
edges and drill for the fixing bolts. A coat of enamel was applied overall, the 
plate was lightly filed to expose the letters then polished. With the 
availability of Digital Cameras this process can be simplified, and a dic with 
the appropriate photograph sent to the engraver the size being simply adjustable 
as required. 

Ron Acock described the use of brass punched letters, obtainable commercially, 
for constructing nameplates. His article in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 161 No.3833 
October 1988 will be found most helpful for the modeller taking that route.

## Chapter 17
*Painting. Workplace and equipment. Types of paint and preparation. The 
finishing coats.*

![SprayCabinet1]

![SprayCabinet3]
> Spray cabinet for small parts from scrap, computer fans and drier hose.

It is quite pleasing to leave the locomotive unpainted as long as possible, the 
parts that won't rust that is. Unfortunately fingerprints on polished mild steel 
may rust overnight so that items such as the mild steel platework have to be 
painted on completion. Otherwise all the stainless, rustless, and gunmetal parts 
can be left unpainted so that one can enjoy the appearance of the raw metal. 
Some parts can be decorated, up to the time of painting, using the age-old 
technique of a split dowel in the lathe or the drill, with a piece of wet and 
dry paper set into the slotted end. this can be set to revolve at speed and the 
part then applied systematically to the ' tool ' This imparts a finish akin to 
that from milling, although on a much finer scale. It looks good in the raw and, 
according to the strength of paper used, provides a nice key for a priming coat 
later. 

### Workplace And Equipment

Whatever finish is selected, the results achieved will depend to some extent on 
the temperature of the workplace. An even temperature and a dust free 
environment are two key aspects to be considered when painting. Probably the 
worst place for the operation is the workshop as there is almost always a film 
of dust from machines and equipment which can easily be disturbed by the 
smallest draught. Good work can be carried out in in a greenhouse or in a spray 
booth set up temporarily using polythene dust sheets from the local D.I.Y store. 
Small parts have been sprayed in a sink in the utility room, the water set 
running over the back surface of the sink by a piece of card, simulating the wet 
back in some commercial spray booths. In the writer's early days of modelmaking, 
a good sized cardboard box for a booth, with a larger box placed overall whilst 
the paint dried, yielded quite satisfactory results. Latterly a simple ' spray 
booth ' for small parts has been fabricated from a steel box, using one of 
Messrs Proops brushless fans and a length of spin-drier hose to take away the 
overspray. 

Regarding equipment, the range is enormous, from simple spray guns to 
sophisticated airbrushes. Expensive equipment does not guarantee good results, 
choice is likely to be based upon one's budget and, provided preparatory work 
has been carefully carried out, good work can be achieved with simple equipment. 
With sound preparation a combination of simple tools used skillfully and ongoing 
care taken in rubbing down and finishing, an excellent paint job will result. 

Spray guns and airbrushes require a satisfactory air supply. Cans of propellant 
are expensive and are soon used up in the course of coating the many parts of a 
locomotive. For economy, a small electric tyre pump can be used to provide an 
air supply via an inner-tube as a reservoir, ( the writer once re-sprayed a 
motor cycle using only a car footpump ! ). Compressors provide a reliable, 
consistent source of supply and need not be expensive although a filter must be 
used to provide a clean supply. There have been several articles in the model 
engineering press on adapting compressors from refrigerators. One very clear 
description was that by Steve Ballinger entitled ' An Airbrush Compressor ' in 
ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE Vol 2, No.5 October 1980. It is important that some 
form of pressure regulator is used as varying paint consistency calls for a 
means of controlling the pressure. The simple ' external mix ' gun can, with 
care, provide a good finish although mix adjustment has to be carried out 
between actuations. The ' internal mix ' tool is probably more favoured by the 
professional and expert, providing as it does more immediate control of the air 
/ paint mix at the touch of the trigger. For occasional use an electric, airless 
spraygun can provide an economic solution and again, excellent results can be 
achieved with care. 

Other equipment includes lint-free cloth, wet and dry paper, rubbing compound, 
metal polish, masking tape and an endless supply of newspaper. Masking film and 
masking fluid will be useful to protect polished parts and to mask-off in the 
course of developing a livery. An out-of-date telephone directory will provide a 
good source of paper for masking purposes and on which to sit small parts for 
painting and some stiff wire hooks will be useful for handling and ' hanging out 
' the parts to dry. A turntable such as those used in icing cakes will also 
prove useful. A good supply of thinners appropriate to the paint system to be 
used is essential. Where paint and thinners are concerned small tins are 
wasteful. Both materials will be cheaper if purchased in sensible quantities 
from a paint supplier. Your local dealer will advise on the type of solvent to 
be used according to the system selected. Paints will keep in the can for years 
provided it is properly sealed, the lid firmly replaced and a seal formed by 
inverting the can before storage. 

Spaying small parts is simplified and can be carried out in the workshop if a 
suitable facility is provided. The simple cabinet illustrated at the top of this 
chapter has proved effective and useful. The ply box has two fans from defunct 
computers mounted high at the back. Extracted air and spray is blown into a 
cone-shaped funnel, which mounts on the ply back, into a length hose from a 
tumble drier and out of a window. At the front of the box a strip of perspex 
prevents overspray from escaping. The whole somewhat ' Sid Carnow ' cabinet can 
be packed together taking the minimum amount of space in a busy workshop. 

### Types Of Paint

Firstly a decision is required regarding the type of paint to be used. The 
choices range from cellulose and acrylic car sprays, through enamels, to special 
heat resistant paints such as those intended for automotive use. The choice 
rests with the individual, but whatever system is selected it has to be 
remembered that sound preparation is critical to achieving a good finish. A 
colleague calls the painting stage ' the spoiling stage ' and this it may well 
prove to be if the preparatory work is hurried or not carried out 
systematically. 

Contact with the suppliers of various types of paint systems reveals an 
interesting fact. On investigation, the majority of complaints regarding 
substandard finishes achieved across a wide range of materials result from 
failure on the part of the user to read, or comply with the manufacturers 
instructions. Whilst it might be argued that the manufacturer is bound to come 
up with this conclusion, it has been proved time and time again that similar 
products have produced differing results in the hands of different people. It 
seems that when all else fails, when the paint fails to dry, or to provide the 
required surface, the user turns to the instructions, or complains to the 
makers! 

### Preparation

LBSC used to advise washing parts to be painted in petrol, this seems a risky 
business and today a thorough wash in detergent, a rinse and then drying in a 
warm spot is probably more effective. The aim here is to remove all traces of 
oil, grease and cutting fluid which will otherwise prevent the priming coats 
bonding to the metal. Failure to remove grease will be evidenced by wrinkling of 
the early coats of primer. Should this be observed then the best course will be 
to go back to the bare metal, thoroughly degrease and start again. 

Whatever paint system is to be used, the same steps are required in preparation 
of the surfaces for paint. Paint will not mask irregularities of surface, it 
will not fill joints and it certainly won't fill holes in castings! Minor 
defects in castings can be filled with a polyester or epoxy filler and rubbed 
down to the required form, a rasp will cut away any overfill and a scraper can 
be used to take the repair to the stage where wet and dry paper will finish the 
job. Castings and any nonferrous surfaces should be coated with an etching 
primer, obtainable from any good automotive paint supplier. This should again be 
cut down using wet and dry paper, recoating and rubbing as necessary to produce 
a consistent matt surface to accept the selected paint. Filler is next, this 
fills any minor defects and can be carefully cut back using wet and dry paper 
until an allover, dead smooth surface results. The paper should always be 
supported, using small blocks of wood or a hard rubber block to ensure that the 
thickness of coating is left consistent throughout, and that corners are not 
exposed, or rounded out. The surface should now be dried. Wiping with a 
lint-free cloth helps, as does leaving the coated part on a radiator for an hour 
or two or spend some time using a hair dryer, the latter technique is good as it 
dries out all the little nooks and crannies in a complex part. Take time, 
attempt to speed things up and the painting stage will rapidly transform into my 
colleagues ' spoiling stage ' ! 

Next is the priming stage, here we are building the surface which will finally 
be apparent. The smoothness of finish achieved at this stage determines the 
appearance of the part after the application of the final coats of paint. This 
is true whatever paint system is adopted. Any small defect after this stage will 
be magnified by succeeding ' finishing ' coats. The use of materials of 
differing colours up to this stage assists by indicating depressions and local 
defect. After each succeeding coat is rubbed down, high spots will be shown up 
by the previous colour, ' grinning through ' and local depressions retain the 
colour of the last coat applied. The aim is consistency and a uniform 
colouration all over the part. Once this stage is reached all is ready for the 
application of the final finishing coat(s) according to the selected sytem. 

### Enamel

Provided one is satisfied with the available colours, brushing enamel provides a 
good durable finish. It is always advisable to warm tins of enamel in a bowl of 
hot water prior to use. Don't shake the tin before use, open it and thoroughly 
stir the contents. Using enamel, applied by brushing, the finish will depend a 
great deal to the quality of the brushes used. Only brushes from a well known 
maker should be used, and they should be washed frequently using thinners and 
finishing with soap and water, as work on any large parts is carried out. This 
avoids problems and brush damage caused by enamel drying where the bristles are 
set into the handle. Carefully dry the brush after this cleaning operation, 
otherwise any moisture remaining in the brush will upset the paint consistency 
on restarting brushwork. Enamels can be spray applied although absolute 
cleanliness of the spray equipment is essential, and defects are not easily 
corrected. 

Whilst ideally one coat of enamel should provide a good quality finish, it is 
sometimes necessary to recoat. Previously coated parts should be set aside for 
the paint to harden before re-coating. A warm, dust-free spot is desirable, a 
cardboard box on top of the central heating boiler has proved effective in the 
past. Before re-coating, the surface should be lightly cut back taking care not 
to remove paint from the corners and edges of the piece. Work painted using 
enamel generally benefits from rubbing and buffing using automotive rubbing 
compound prior to finishing with metal polish, these processes should be carried 
out over a few square inches at a time, first rubbing, then buffing. A soft 
brush will be needed when polishing rivetted surfaces, care being taken to avoid 
exposing the metal of the rivet heads by rubbing too hard. 

### Heat Resistant Paints

Heat-curing paints can be used to advantage on the smokebox and chimney. These 
paints, applied from a spray can, are cured either by the heat of operation, by 
blowlamp or by baking in the oven. Heating parts coated with this material in a 
very hot oven ( Regulo No. 9 ) for half an hour proved satisfactory in the case 
of Pixie. The black finish obtained is midway between eggshell and gloss and can 
be maintained by a light rub with an oily rag. The black heat resisting paint in 
spray cans so beloved of motorcycle enthusiasts is great for chimneys, 
smokeboxes and similar items. Oven or gentle heat from a blowlamp will cure it 
to a satisfying matt finish. 

### Spray Cans, Guns And Airbrushes

When painting using spray cans, the can must warmed gently before being shaken 
according to the makers instructions, generally for some minutes after the 
mixing ball is heard to rattle within the can. The spray should be tested to 
determine the spray pattern and the distance of the jet from the work by trials 
on a piece of scrap. With both cans and guns the spray should be started away to 
one side of the part being coated and carried across the part several times 
before moving away from the workpiece to stop the spray. In this way the finish 
will not be marred by blobs of paint which often occur when starting and 
stopping the paint flow. Before succeeding coats are applied, (some instructions 
say that the succeeding coats should be applied quite soon, whilst the previous 
coat is tacky even, others require a dry finish before recoating) the parts 
should be turned to ensure that all edges are coated. The temptation to build 
with one coat of spray has to be resisted. A series of thin coats always gives 
the best results. Building should be done in the course of a series of coats, 
rubbing down between each coat. 

When using an airbrush much better control of the paint and thus regulation of 
the coating is possible, the most critical aspect here being the cleanliness of 
the equipment. Paint consistency is important and it is advisable to strain all 
but the freshest paints. Mix the paint by stirring, not by shaking the can. 
Always test the consistency of the paint on a piece of scrap before coating any 
model parts. Most paints also benefit from straining after mixing, strainer 
material can be obtained from model or automotive spares suppliers. When 
deciding on the correct mix of thinner and paint, start on a piece of scrap with 
a 30 - 50 percent thinner content, adding more until the flow is correct. A 
short blow of air alone will clear the brush if it clogs. Always clean the 
airbrush using thinners immediately on finishing painting, any minute flake of 
paint that dries on the tool could spoil the next job to be tackled. 

During the coating process the air brush should be kept on the move, using a 
motion of the hand and arm which maintains the head at a constant distance from 
the surface and sweeps the piece with spray. Movement of the wrist varies this 
distance and prevents even coating. Spraying should be started and stopped away 
from the piece being coated. Runs and pools of paint result when the brush is 
stationary for even a second. When paint dries too quickly, before reaching the 
part being coated, a rough texture develops. Ideally the coat should appear to 
shine as it is applied, rapidly drying as the spray is moved on. 

### Dealing With Defects

Whatever tools are being used in the painting process, should there be the 
slightest evidence of a run or ' orange peel ' surface developing *no attempt 
should be made to rectify things by wiping with a cloth*. This action can result 
in the removal of the current coat of paint and parts of the previous coats 
which have become softened by the spray. The components should be set aside for 
the paint to harden completely then the surface can be cut back with successive 
strengths of wet and dry paper, care being taken not to expose primer at edges 
and corners. Once a uniform, matt finish is achieved overall, then priming, 
rubbing down then re-coating can commence.
