## Foreword
( This was written when the book was first published on 2 Floppy 
disks !.....John ) 

I have, over the last few years, had the pleasure of watching Pixie grow, from a 
design concept through to a finished locomotive. this has been thanks to 
occasional personal contact, and largely through the occasional articles 
submitted to MODEL ENGINEER magazine detailing progress to the latest stage.The 
author is a meticulous craftsman, with a well developed and organised workshop, 
each feature being installed as a result of considerable thought. That he has 
chosen to set out this account of his activities, revealing both the triumphs 
and difficulties encountered in the construction, is a tribute to his meticulous 
recording of his work. 

Of all the books that I have read concerning the building of small locomotives, 
this one adopts a novel approach, taking as a starting point the actual workroom 
or other premises which are to be used for the work. Very often this is a facet 
of locomotive building which is neglected; leading to considerable problems 
later. 

I like the attention to detail, the account of the research needed to bring the 
product to fruition, the novel approach to pattern making, and the authors 
somewhat novel approach to gleaning much of the material needed.This is a very 
readable account of the building of a well detailed locomotive and, as 
importantly, the many hints and tips of a practical nature passed for the 
benefit of other constructors by the author. 

One can only applaud his industry in making the volume available in this 
fashion, I for one wish the volume every success.

## Chapter 1
### Choice Of Prototype
### Why Narrow Gauge?

*Choice of prototype. Space, weight and scale considerations. Location of track.
Haulage and handling considerations.*

Narrow gauge locomotives and rolling stock, as we in the United Kingdom know 
them, have a flavour of their own, quite removed from the nature of those of 
standard gauge railways. Historically narrow gauge lines, essentially light 
railways, have been quaint and often slow moving yet, in their own way efficient 
servants of the community. They and their dedicated staff have traditionally 
provided a personal, if somewhat erratic service, perhaps running in fits and 
starts, sometimes even stopping for an individual passenger at a field gate. 
History also records instances where the traveller has been required to assist 
in re-railing a piece of stock or in fetching water for the boiler! 

Narrow gauge lines have a history of running on uneven, occasionally weed 
overgrown track. They take acute bends and steep gradients in their stride, 
rarely travelling at speeds exceeding 20 m.p.h. The locomotives are picturesque, 
often of short wheelbase, sometimes with with small boilers, tall chimneys, 
intricate weather plates and other interesting items of equipment. In some 
instances narrow gauge locomotives are festooned with 'Victoriana' in the form 
of sandpots, polished plumbing and literally all manner of bells and whistles. 
Having said all that, we have to remember that on most continents there are 
narrow gauge (narrower than standard gauge that is) locomotives working over 
hundreds of miles of mountainous and inhospitable countryside. Such for example 
are the metre gauge railways of India and Malaya, and the South African and 
Ecuadorian Railways of 3 foot 6 inch gauge. In this book we concern ourselves 
with the narrower gauges and the smaller locomotives which have come to regarded 
in this country as the 'Norm' for narrow gauge. 

There is a wide range of prototypes from which to make a selection. Firstly 
there are the conventional locomotives, often carrying out the duties of 
standard gauge locomotives over difficult terrain. Then there are tram 
locomotives, which worked in the industrial or urban environment, many of these 
are notable for their shrouded wheels and motion and controlled emissions of 
smoke and steam. They would be designed to be controlled from each end of the 
footplate, also hand and steam brakes would be compulsory. A number of tram 
locomotives were built with vertical boilers, an added touch of interest in 
model form. Vertical boilered locomotive models provide the builder with an 
opportunity to incorporate some previously built essay in model engineering, 
such as a Stuart Turner engine into their model. De Winton locomotives with 
vertical boilers and cylinders were virtually an engine platform with water 
tank, bunkers, reversing lever and brake standard. Inside and outside frame 
configurations were employed, also inside and outside drive, the latter by lay 
shaft and crank. R.A.S Abbot in his book on the topic describes how some 
locomotives carried the chimney directly above the boiler to avoid the formation 
of condensation and some locomotives were fired by sliding the fuel down chutes 
into the firebox located between the frames, plenty of scope here for the 
freelance modelmaker ! In an article in MODEL ENGINEER Vol 163 No.3859 October 
1989, Phil Atkinson gave the reader food for thought in his description of ' 
Coffee pot locomotives ' outshopped from Head Wrightsons Works in the late 
1800's, with their heavily riveted vertical boilers and substantial wheelsets, 
these little locomotives would present a challenge, and a reward for the 
builder. A surprising feature of the locomtive was a one piece, cast iron frame 
incorporating main side members, buffer beams, the fuel bunker, all foot plates 
and the stiffening ribs, the whole described by Phil as a fine piece of the 
Victorian designers, pattern makers and iron founders art. No. 16 by the same 
builder even sports a rudimentary roof although one which would afford little 
protection to the driver ! 

For added spice, builders may turn their attention to innovative locomotives 
such as LOCOMOTIVE NO. 1 of the Listowel & Ballybunnion Railway, straddling an 
early monorail. Double-bogied types such as those of the Festiniog Railway would 
present a challenge, or perhaps the modeller would wish to undertake a model of 
one of the the SHAYS or HEISLERS of the American short lines scene. Ken Swan's 
series on 'KOPPEL' a rack locomotive in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE could prompt 
the modeller to produce, for instance, a model of Locomotive Number 7 on the 
Snowdon Mountain Railway, although track construction would present a major 
challenge. Those seeking a simpler prototype would do well to build the 
locomotive Ross Harrison described commencing in ENGINEERING in MINIATURE, issue 
of September 1982, a convincing model in 5" gauge based upon 'EDWARD THOMAS', 
Kerr Stuart 'Tattoo' Class locomotive built in 1921 for the Corris Railway, 
later moved to the the Talyllin Railway, a model full of atmosphere. 

For something really different the modeller might turn to the locomotives of a 
Dublin Brewery, designed by Samuel Geoghegan. These 1 foot 10 inch gauge 
locomotives with cylinders and motion placed ABOVE the boiler were used in 
conjunction with haulage trucks into which they were hoisted for working the 5 
foot 3 inch gauge. In this role the wheels of the locomotive rested on grooved 
rollers which propelled the trucks. Contractors locomotives make interesting 
prototypes and many model engineers have built 'SWEET PEA', designed along these 
lines by Jack Buckler. Some of these models exhibit remarkable modifications and 
there is scope for innovation. This locomotive would make an ideal test-bed for 
the model engineer who likes to experiment with features of his own design. 
Contractors locomotives provide a range of prototypes suited to modelling and it 
is a salutary thought that narrow gauge locomotives such as the Bagnall 
locomotive 'EXCELSIOR', a delightful little 0-4-0, were employed in much 
industrial construction as well as civil engineering works for railways. 

A series of articles by Martin Evans in MODEL ENGINEER commencing in 1980 
described a free lance narrow gauge 0-4-0 Saddle Tank Locomotive, 'CONWAY'. This 
again was a blow-by-blow description and, as with all Martin Evans designs, 
examples of the completed model have been seen performing credibly on a many 
occasions. 

The modeller fortunate enough to locate the Armley Industrial Museum in Leeds 
can find there the beautifully preserved Hunslett narrow gauge locomotive 
'JACK', resplendent in scarlet livery, lined in yellow and black. Built in 1898 
for employment in a fireclay works near Burton-on Trent, 'JACK' is outside 
framed, has Baguley valve gear and masses of brass and copper in the steam dome 
and plumbing, with brass lubricators mounted on the smokebox. On top of the 
boiler are twin sand boxes and the loco has some nice details such as the hinged 
lights on the weather board and the drain pipes from the cylinders passing 
through the front beam. Running like a Rolls Royce it is a wonderful sight and 
one to make any model engineers pulse skip a beat. 'JACK' featured on the cover 
of MODEL ENGINEER Vol 158, No. 3798 April 1987 and a description of the 
locomotive appeared in that journal of October 1984 

Lest it be thought that narrow gauge locomotives are mainly of simple design 
there are many examples way and beyond 0-4-0 configuration as regards 
complexity. These will present just as much of a challenge as a standard gauge 
locomotive. For example there are the Manning Wardle & Co. 2-6-2 side tank 
locomotives and the 2-4-2, Baldwin, 'LYN' of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. 
('LEW' of this railway is, at the time of writing, being described in a 
construction series for 3 1/2 inch gauge in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE.) For the 
really adventurous constructor there are of course the 2-6-2 + 2-6-2 Garrats of 
the South African and Indian railways. 

Decisions, decisions....! 

The writer's decision to model PIXIE the Kerr Stuart ' Wren' Class locomotive 
KS4260 / 1922 was based upon several factors. First and foremost was the 
impression that the sight of the little locomotive as it coasted into Pages Park 
Station on the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway one spring afternoon. It 
seemed incredible that a locomotive, produced initially for work on the 
installation of a sewer in 1922, should 60 years later be found running like a 
Rolls-Royce and doing useful work in a domestic setting. Enquiries revealed a 
little of the history of the locomotive, the fact that after the completion of 
the Barkingside sewer contract it had for some years worked in the Wilmington 
Road Quarry of Devon County Council, eventually being purchased by the 
Industrial Locomotive Society and brought to Leighton Buzzard in the late 
1960's. The locomotive has an overall length of something over 10 feet, it 
weighs 3 Tons 7 cwt empty, and 4 tons 3 cwt in working order. The inside framed 
locomotive has Hackworth valve gear and is resplendent in an attractive livery 
of black, green and gold. 

Here was a locomotive that was mechanically quite simple for a relative beginner 
to construct, It would be accessible for survey and was in the hands of friendly 
folk who were prepared to assist with provision of information. The railway was 
within 25 miles of home base, so that the survey could be staged over a series 
of visits. Above all, the locomotive had an atmosphere and charm which appeared 
to the writer to convey the very essence of narrow gauge railways. The decision 
has never been regretted and has, over the past ten years, opened up a whole new 
interest in the mechanical engineering of railways and of narrow gauge railways 
in particular. 

At this stage the modeller intending to work in narrow gauge has to come to 
terms with the fact that just as much work will be involved in producing his 
chosen model as in producing one to run on standard gauge. Pixie was ten years 
in the building, through choice. Some things are too good to hurry and although 
one is always keen to get one's first locomotive onto the track, later efforts 
can be savoured, and perhaps greater attention paid to detail. In some instances 
such as for instance if a decision was made to model 'MERDDYN EMRYS', of 
Festiniog Railway fame, far more work could be involved. There could however be 
a saving in unit time in producing duplicate equipment, motion, tanks etc. In 
practice some builders do make locomotives in pairs and professionals make 
batches for just this reason. 

### Size

Although construction of a sizeable standard gauge model locomotive may make 
excessive demands on the capacity of one's workshop and equipment, narrow gauge 
locomotives are generally simpler in design and, at the same scale, work up 
smaller in model form. ( This fact can be used to advantage by the modeller 
'moving-up' to a larger scale). The flavour of work and operations on a narrow 
gauge line can be replicated within a small workshop and in ones own backyard. 
Model engineering activities along narrow gauge lines' provide every opportunity 
for the incorporation into models of the very things that attract us to the 
prototype, to make and handle the artifacts that would otherwise, unless one 
works as a volunteer on a preserved line, be literally beyond reach. It should 
be remembered however that modelled on 5" Gauge quite a small locomotive such as 
PIXIE, at some 10 feet overall, will be more than 25" long in model form and of 
such dry weight that it is beyond one (normal) man's lifting ability! Quite 
apart from the weight of the model the physical size, 25" long x 11.5" wide by 
20" high are dimensions to be reckoned with when it comes to handling in the 
workshop and between shop and track! These details will not daunt the enthusiast 
however and ways and means are discussed later in this book. 

### Scale Considerations

There are many factors to be considered when deciding upon the scale in which to 
model the chosen prototype. Whilst often one reads a statement that ' such and 
such a scale was chosen because of the equipment available on which to machine 
the parts' there is a lot more to be taken into consideration! Even a model of a 
small locomotive like PIXIE requires space for storage, maneuvering from storage 
to the track and general handling for maintenance and overhaul. In the case of 
Pixie it became necessary to build the hoist detailed in chapter xxx to carry 
out these simple exercises in comfort! 

One can comfortably carry out the machining operations for a 5" Gauge narrow 
gauge locomotive on a lathe in the Myford, ' maid of all work' series, or some 
similar equipment. In case of need, one can often obtain assistance with larger 
components from a local engineering works or by enrolling at a local Evening 
Institute. Many trojans work on 7 1/4" Gauge although here the parts, 
particularly the boiler assume relatively massive proportions. The enthusiast 
will tell you that these aspects are offset by the ride-in capability of their 
models and one can see their point of view. Access to a suitable track for 
running a 7 1/4" locomotive is however likely to be beyond the reach of many 
people, depending of course upon geographical location. On the other hand, 3 
1/2" and 5" Gauge tracks are generally accessible, the local club probably 
offers both facilities and one will not require a pantechnicon to get the 
locomotive there. 3 1/2" gauge locomotives will fit easily into the family car 
as will some 5" gauge models, although larger locomotives on this gauge may 
require a purpose-made trailer. Narrow gauge locos for 5" track can be loaded 
into an estate car, and at a pinch can be manhandled by two strong men. Models 
scaled to 5" gauge offer sturdiness of components capable of surviving such 
rigorous handling. There are numerous designs and details available. Over the 
years, blow by blow descriptions of the construction of such models have 
appeared in the model press. Narrow gauge on 3 1/2" track can be ideal for a 
garden railway but for ride-behind fun the larger gauge has more to offer. In 
the case of a model such as Pixie, 2 1/2" to the foot scale on 5" gauge provides 
a stable ride, with a locomotive that has heft, and parts that are definitely 
out of the 'watchmaking' class! At this scale too the locomotive is robust, the 
firehole door whilst small provides a reasonable target for firing on the move 
and the levers and valves are sufficiently large to convey the feeling of the 
real thing in use. 

### Track Location

Of course the ideal track location must be around one's own garden. Few of us 
however, are fortunate enough to have sufficient space at our disposal, 
particularly for anything other than an out-and-back track. Having said that, 
the out-and-back track has its merits. It can be simple, relatively cheap to 
construct and lay, as well as providing a useful test facility. Whilst it would 
be grand to have a railway sweeping round the grounds, there is a lot to be said 
for 50' or so of portable track that can be laid down on the lawn or the terrace 
when required. Such a track avoids problems with landscaping and garden 
maintenance such as weeding and grass cutting. When the urge to steam a 
locomotive arises it is a simple matter to fetch the lengths of track from the 
shed or garage, lay them down, fasten a few fishplates, and be ready to run. One 
length of such track, carried into the workshop, will prove useful when setting 
valves and carrying out routine maintenance. Construction of a suitable track 
system is described and illustrated in a later Chapter. 

The more fortunate may have space available which will permit a complete 
circuit, with perhaps a siding into a storage shed. This is not beyond the 
bounds of a medium sized backyard and one hears of 0-4-0 locomotives happily 
negotiating 6 foot radius curves although it has to be said that the larger the 
radius the better. Certainly a small engine shed could be made to look most 
attractive and its location on the running ground would avoid a lot of effort 
that otherwise has to be expended in handling between steamings. 

### Haulage And Handling Considerations

Where there is sufficient space it is convenient to store the locomotive in the 
workshop. Failing this, perhaps a corner of the garden shed or garage can be set 
aside. It will prove helpful if the loco can be kept stored on a small trolley, 
Pixie's trolley is of Dexion angle, provided with a length of track and some 
stops to immobilise her in transit from the track to store and back. The trolley 
is described in Ch 17. Some splendid trolleys have been described in the model 
press from time to time. The modelmaker who intends to build up a locomotive 
stud, and take locomotives to club meets and similar events will do well to 
construct something similar to facilitate loading into the the car or van. One 
of the writer's acquaintances has a purpose-modified road trailer fitted with 
track on which two sizable locos can sit in transit, secured by bottle screws 
between strong points on the locomotives frames and the trailer body. Tool and 
coal storage is provided in the well of the trailer. The locomotives live on the 
trailer between meets and the trailer is ready for instant coupling to the 
family car, a good incentive to get out and about to meets and rallies. 

As well as trolleys and trailers some ingenious hoists have been described in 
the model press, one hoist was designed to be coupled to the towing ball hitch 
on the back of a car for stability whilst lifting. The hoist used for handling 
Pixie, described later, is used to handle the locomotive in the workshop and at 
the garden track. It could be rendered more mobile by the insertion of splices 
in the leg frame to enable it to be transported by car. If this was done the 
original 'test load', two and a half bags of cement would be called into action 
once again to prove the mechanics. Hoisting a locomotive calls for a 
custom-built spreader bar to ensure that no damage is suffered in the course of 
a lift, and time spent getting the correct balance of the locomotive whilst 
suspended on such a spreader will ensure safety.

## Chapter 2

*Establishing detail. Research. Manufacturers drawings. Commercially available designs. Value of the model press, exhibitions and club membership.*

### Establishing Detail

The amount of research required will depend upon whether the modeller chooses to 
produce an accurate scale model, or a near scale model. In the former case a 
massive amount of detail will be necessary, to the point of the sometimes 
derided ' rivet counting' exercise '. To embark on a scale model of a locomotive 
from 'scratch' is to commit oneself to many months and perhaps years of work. 
For the scale modeller every detail has significance, every modification to the 
original design has be faithfully reproduced and incorporated into the model. 
The problem here is that the components may prove to be too delicate to stand up 
to service on the track and there has to be a temptation towards some judicious 
beefing-up of parts. Fortunately if the choice is a narrow-gauge model on 5 inch 
gauge track the various components will work up to be quite substantial and 
durable in use. 

The near scale modeller whilst perhaps taking a more relaxed approach to detail 
has nevertheless to convey the atmosphere of prototype through the parts that he 
does include. He is fortunate in having the opportunity to make parts a little 
more solidly than they would be in true scale and thus a little less vulnerable 
to damage on the track. As we have said before modelling is a very personal 
process. Whatever the degree of scale accuracy is decided upon, careful research 
is required. The word ' Research ' sounds quite impressive. In fact it really describes a process that 
every enthusiast follows naturally in the course of enjoying his hobby, that of 
ferreting out detail on a topic which he finds interesting. The sources of 
information are many and varied, ranging from contact with individuals having 
personal knowledge of the topic, manufacturers, museum archives, libraries, 
railway sites, Model Engineering Societies and Preservation Societies. Once 
one's mind is set on a particular prototype there seems no end to the sources of 
information. The only problem is that in the back of one's mind there is always 
always the feeling that some source is being overlooked. The modeller may rest 
assured however, if there is some inaccuracy or anachronism, someone with expert 
knowledge will probably put him right at time of the models first public 
appearance! 

### Manufacturers Drawings And Photographs

We may be fortunate enough to have a sight of manufacturers drawings, if not 
directly, at second hand. Many of the books on narrow-gauge railways shew 
illustrations of these drawings which can be worked-up for use as detail in 
constructing a model. Photographs of locomotives in the outshopped state are an 
institution. No manufacturer ' worthy of his salt' would have outshopped a 
locomotive and sent it away to his customer without having it photographed in 
its pristine state. These photographs are worth their weight in gold to the 
enthusiastic model engineer who can enlarge detail and glean useful information 
for model making purposes. Failing works drawings or manufacturers photographs, 
the authors of many of the series of construction articles published in the 
model press base their work and the drawings accompanying the text on detail 
taken from manufacturers drawings. 

Some books such as those on narrow-gauge lines noted in the bibliography 
include, as appendices, quite detailed drawings of the locomotives and stock of 
the lines they describe. When supplemented by detail derived from the 
photographic illustrations, these small scale drawings can provide sufficient 
detail for the model engineer wishing to produce a near scale model. Typical of 
these, and on the face of things an unlikely source book i s ' Narrow Gauge 
Railway Modelling ' by D A Boreham. Intended for workers in 7mm scale this book 
includes nicely produced general assembly drawings of such locomotives as 
Locomotives 1 & 2 of the Festiniog Railway and 'Mary' by W. G. Bagnall as worked 
by Cliffe Hill Granite Company. The book ' The Lynton and Barnstable Railway 
1895-1935' by L.T. Catchpole includes works line drawings of the three Manning 
and Wardle locomotives and the Baldwin which reveal essential detail for the 
modelmaker. 

Over the years some excellent, and generally quite accurate, outline drawings 
have been published in the model railway press devoted to 4mm and similar scale 
modelling. These drawings provide a basis for an excellent model when used in 
conjunction with standard details of parts gleaned from the pages of MODEL 
ENGINEERING and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE and such standard works as LBSCs ' Shop 
Shed and Road ' and Martin Evans ' Manual of Model Steam Locomotive Construction 
'. Whilst in the main these books cater for the modeller working on standard 
gauge, mechanical principles do not vary from those of the narrower gauge. As 
discussed earlier much of narrow-gauge mechanical engineering is of a simpler 
design than that of the big stuff but there is no reason why, within the ' 
innards ' of a narrow gauge locomotive, one should not employ more advanced 
methods. 

### Research

A visit to the local library will reveal a wealth of publications touching upon 
the subject of narrow-gauge railway operations, locomotives and rolling stock. A 
brief perusal of the advertisements in the model press will serve to remind us 
of the considerable number of books available for purchase. A search of the 
stock on the bookstall at the next model railway exhibition will yield a 
surprising amount of information which is specific to narrow gauge. In the 
run-up to commencing a model, it is worthwhile copying or noting for reference 
material likely to be useful when the work begins. Often one encounters 
photographs showing useful detail in the most unlikely places. Newspapers, 
magazines, guide books and holiday advertisements have all yielded useful data 
in their time. The writer with his interest in sketching and drawing decided to 
measure from the prototype, meanwhile enjoying the visits to the line and 
contact with the volunteers working on the stock there. This may not be a 
feasible approach for many and other means of establishing detail become 
imperative. Brochures, postcards, and some posters for the Leighton Buzzard 
Narrow Gauge Railway provided photographs, which were of immense value in 
confirming detail achieved from survey. The modeller will do well to seek out 
similar details of his projected prototype. 

Researching a model can be tremendous fun. Recent research took the writer to an 
industrial museum in the Midlands to meet a voluntary archivist. Working in the 
bowels of the museum this gentleman, a volunteer with years of experience within 
the engineering industry, specific to locomotive design and construction behind 
him, spends his time cataloguing works drawings saved from destruction at the 
time of the demise of an internationally known manufacturer. He has become known 
to many enthusiasts and is constantly called upon to supply information on 
requests from correspondents all over the the world. In fact, so busy are he and 
a colleague, that they cannot publicise their facilities in case excess demand 
should bring their activities to a halt! Perhaps in the course of research the 
reader will be fortunate enough to meet similar kind folk. 

### Commercial Designs

During the past 20 years there have been many series of articles on the 
construction of narrow-gauge locomotives, notable are those on the construction 
of CONWAY, a freelance narrow-gauge 0-4-0 Saddle Tank locomotive for 3 1/2 inch 
gauge by Martin Evans, in MODEL ENGINEER of 1980. Other practical designs are 
the freelance model ' SWEET PEA ' mentioned earlier in this book and described 
in a series of articles in ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE. Whilst such designs are 
initially prepared for the benefit of the readers of the journal, commercial 
concerns soon set themselves up to provide the necessary materials and 
particularly castings for featured locomotives. In this way the modeller gains 
the advantage of an economic supply of raw materials and is, should he so wish, 
relieved of the work of producing his own patterns 

The model engineer should not overlook designs for which part, or fully 
machined, sets of parts are available, particularly as these models have been 
built in large numbers and have proved themselves as runners on tracks 
throughout the world. Kits of ready machined parts such as those available from 
Messrs MAXITRACK have served to introduce many modellers to the delights of 
model engineering. Once having assembled a model from a set of parts, production 
and assembly of ones own parts seems just a small step to take. 

### The Model Press, Publications, Exhibitions And Club Membership

As will be evidenced by the frequent references in this book, the writer is an 
avid reader of a number of model engineering publications. These range from 
MODEL ENGINEER and ENGINEERING IN MINIATURE to the excellent series of 
publications by such firms as ARGUS BOOKS and THE OAKWOOD PRESS. Magazines 
devoted to specialised topics such as small scale railway modelling have 
information to offer. It is well worth taking time to note articles which 
contain detail which can prove useful at some later date, a note of the magazine 
or source made in the diary or logbook can save hours of searching later. 

Most of the existing narrow gauge railways have a bookshop at the main depot as 
do industrial museums up and down the country. Stocks within these shops often 
contain valuable information for the would-be modeller, most for example have 
some write-up of the history of the line and its equipment, or in the case of 
museums a description of a specific locomotive exhibit, containing valuable 
illustrations. Picture postcards and posters are another source of information 
and with care can be used to supplement surveys and drawings. 

National and Local Exhibitions provide an opportunity for contact with trade 
suppliers, and other enthusiasts who can provide leads on sources of 
information. The models exhibited often reveal useful detail, and contact with 
the producer can assist in extending ones knowledge of methods and techniques. 
There is often a stand where known experts give demonstrations and provide 
advice on problems. Bookstalls at exhibitions can provide a useful source of 
information, on occasions it has been possible to pick up a years back numbers 
of journals for quite reasonable sums, reasonable when one considers the wealth 
of information contained therein. 

Club membership has a great deal to offer, particularly where the newcomer to 
model engineering is concerned. There is never any shortage of know-how or 
advice. Frequently one or other of the members is specialist in or has specific 
knowledge of a particular railway, having perhaps worked on the line or more 
recently done voluntary work in preservation. Club membership may well present 
other advantages such as access to machines and services and sometimes 
discounted prices on materials from a local supplier. Local club programmes 
often include talks and demonstrations by visiting speakers, specialist in some 
branch of model making such as boilermaking, painting and so on, these events 
are particularly beneficial to the beginner.
