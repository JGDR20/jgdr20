These are models that I have buit over the years, just as my interest grabbed me. 
They show various levels of skill and varying interests through the years.

## Vespa

![Vespa]
> This is a model made from wood and card in 1951 of my beloved Piaggio 'Vespa' 
motor scooter

The prototype was one of the first imported into the country and at 125cc it 
proved to be a trojan. My wife and I travelled the country, 36,000 miles around 
the South Coast and Cornwall and in London, with petrol at two shillings and 
sixpence a gallon provided 120 miles of travel. I eventually added a sidecar for 
my wife and our first born child...magic !

![VespaArticle]
> In the archives I found a copy of Model Maker dated 1954, this was the the 
main magazine for model enthusiasts of 'All convictions '. I found an article 
which earned me the princely sum of 2Gns. Excuse the poor old image, the 
magazine is 58 years old !

## Solid Cartoons

I mentioned elsewhere my 2-dmensional cartoons for techical purposes, the 
following are from a selection of ' In the solid Cartoons ' made from odd scraps 
and offcuts using the now ancient bandsaw, and some wire and a tube of Bostic 
adhesive. These items are all that are necessary to let the imagination run 
riot !

![Sailing2]
> Here we show what could well have been an incident in our early sailing days !
The third member of the crew is somwhere downstream !

---
<br>

![CrewDownstream2]
> Here is the sequel, the other member of the crew downstream clutching the 
second oar! This lot are all very stupid...of course you will have noticed by 
now that none of them are wearing lifejackets, perhaps these incidents will 
convince them to think again.

![ManOverboard]
> Little could be worse than a child overboard. Rescued in the nick of time ! 
Always important to keep one's eyes on children. Moored or afloat, a tether is 
the best solution, particularly on sailing craft.

![StayInTheShallowEnd]
> At some time of our lives most of us have been told ' Stay in the shallow 
end ' by one or other of our elders. There is obviously a degree of motivation 
in this case !
> 
> This ' Cartoon ' was gifted to a young woman who spends a great deal of time 
on ( and sometimes in ) the water, a young, Olympic hopeful friend of mine.

![BoysLaunch]
> This boat will look familiar to any model boat fans. A neighbour visiting my 
workshop was intrigued to see a model of the boat the he served on in World War 
2 !
> 
> This is a boat that I built 40+ years ago to be enjoyed by my two sons, it is 
actually from a kit for an R.A.F fire tender. It ran on a 6V battery powering a 
Meccano motor. It nearly planed but was fast enough to please two youngsters. 
Now with a more suitable power supply and a better motor it does plane !

![ClydePufferKit]
> This is a proprietary model of a Clyde Puffer, one of the three kit models in 
my workshop.
> 
> I love this model for its background on the Clyde and am impressed by the 
detail that the manufacturer makes available to all builders.
> 
> It was given to me by an ex-navy friend many years ago and it still performs 
beautifully, the kit is still available commercially and can be thoroughly 
recommended.

![Laser]
> This model is of my Laser which I owned for several years, sailing it on the 
Thames, the south coast and in Cornwall. A small problem... it was possible to 
set out without the drain plug installed, this would result in all manner of 
problems with steering and stability !
> 
> I spent a good deal of time in the water in earlier days with it, it was a 
ball of fire compared with the mirror dinghy that I had sailed 30 years before 
and the cruising boats in the interim ! The model, which is static, was simple 
to make and brings back many happy memories.

## Steam
Now for some Steam...............

![Stuart2]
> My first venture into Model Engineering. It was a good piece on which to learn
................. and make mistakes without them being too costly!
> 
> It is what could be regarded as an ' Apprentice piece ' . It arrived in the 
post from Stuart Models all contained on a shrink wrapped card, a little bit 
daunting in the first instance but it taught me how to use my shiny new Myford 
without damage to people or property.

![Stuart1]
> The twin came next, the Stuart catologue is to blame for this one, it seemed a 
logical step from the first effort above.
> 
> Further along the learning curve, as will be noted from the solder joints on 
the oversize oiler, soldering was an art yet to be achieved.

![Stuart3]
> A friend found the bones of this one when clearing out a shed and knowing my 
interests he passed it on to me.
> 
> Larger yet than the previous pair and so powerful that this fellow, also a 
Stuart, would wreak a great deal of damage to a finger that strayed. This one a
rrived in very poor, incomplete order, probably an attempt discarded by a 
previous owner. It included different metals in its construction to those of the 
previous two, so more lessons had to be learned.
