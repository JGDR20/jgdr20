### Ideas

* 'Flippable' mobile processor
  * Independent wheels on roof
* Rescue/crane unit
  * Rotors and pistons to landing gear
  * Lift damaged/turtled craft, rotate and set back down
* Mobile power plant
  * 9x9 grid
  * Wind tubines raised on corners
  * Piston+Landing gear to become 'stationary' on-site, retract for movement
